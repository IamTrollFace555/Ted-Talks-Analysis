17035;Why we must protect the digital rights of children;On any given day, the rights of millions of children are routinely ignored as they are surveilled, exploited and manipulated by private entities via their digital interactions. Filmmaker and activist Baroness Beeban Kidron makes the case that the rights enshrined by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child should extend to the digital realm. To this end, she lays out the framework of 5rights, the initiative she founded to deliver children's rights online. ;2;
17023;How data brokers sell your identity;When tech journalist Madhumita Murgia began researching data brokers -- companies that collect and sell individuals' personal data -- she wasn't remotely prepared for the deep, dark rabbit hole she was about to descend into. Online anonymity is dead, your smart TV is spying on you, and private companies know what Star Wars memorabilia you're looking for before you do.

16820;What marrying an immigrant taught me about cultural bias;When Kyle Quinn married his Brazilian wife and brought her home to the United States, he assumed the difficult part was over and that they could forge a happy life together. What he didn't anticipate was a front-row seat to the indignitiesÉ??big and smallÉ??that immigrants face on a regular basis.

Appearing as a hologram live from Tel Aviv, Harari warns that the greatest danger that now faces liberal democracy is that the revolution in information technology will make dictatorships more efficient and capable of control. ""The enemies of liberal democracy hack our feelings of fear and hate and vanity, and then use these feelings to polarize and destroy,"" Harari says.

13340;The age-old sharing economies of Africa -- and why we should scale them;From rides to homes and beyond, we're sharing everything these days, with the help of digital tools. But as modern and high-tech as the sharing economy seems, it's been alive in Africa for centuries, according to author Robert Neuwirth.

15553;The doctors, nurses and aid workers rebuilding Syria;"Local humanitarians are beacons of light in the darkness of war, says humanitarian aid entrepreneur and TED Fellow Rola Hallam. She's working to help responders on the ground in devastated communities like Syria, where the destruction of health care is being used as a weapon of war. One of her campaigns achieved a global first: a crowdfunded hospital. Since it opened in 2017, the aptly named Hope Hospital has treated thousands of children.

Her inventions -- designed to chop vegetables, cut hair, apply lipstick and more -- rarely (if ever) succeed, and that's the point. ""The true beauty of making useless things [is] this acknowledgment that you don't always know what the best answer is,"" Giertz says.

15149;It's time for the law to protect victims of gender violence;"To make accountability the norm after gender violence in the United States, we need to change tactics, says victims' rights attorney and TED Fellow Laura L. Dunn. Instead of going institution by institution, fighting for reform, we need to go to the Constitution and finally pass the Equal Rights Amendment, which would require states to address gender inequality and violence. By ushering in sweeping change, Dunn says, ""our legal system can become a system of justice, and #MeToo can finally become 'no more.'""";2;

15274;Is the world getting better or worse? A look at the numbers;"Was 2017 really the ""worst year ever,"" as some would have us believe? In his analysis of recent data on homicide, war, poverty, pollution and more, psychologist Steven Pinker finds that we're doing better now in every one of them when compared with 30 years ago. But progress isn't inevitable, and it doesn't mean everything gets better for everyone all the time, Pinker says. Instead, progress is problem-solving, and we should look at things like climate change and nuclear war as problems to be solved, not apocalypses in waiting. ""We will never have a perfect world, and it would be dangerous to seek one,"" he says. ""But there's no limit to the betterments we can attain if we continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing.""";2;
15214;Empathy is not endorsement;"Digital creator Dylan Marron has racked up millions of views for projects like ""Every Single Word"" and ""Sitting in Bathrooms With Trans People"" -- but he's found that the flip side of success online is internet hate. Over time, he's developed an unexpected coping mechanism: calling the people who leave him insensitive comments and asking a simple question: ""Why did you write that?"" In a thoughtful talk about how we interact online, Marron explains how sometimes the most subversive thing you can do is actually speak with people you disagree with, not simply at them.";2;

In this moving talk, join Rhimes on a journey through her ""year of yes"" and find out how she got her hum back.";2;
2761;The science of skin color;When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin, it affects each of us differently. Depending on skin color, it'll take only minutes of exposure to turn one person beetroot-pink, while another requires hours to experience the slightest change. What's to account for that difference, and how did our skin come to take on so many different hues to begin with? Angela Koine Flynn describes the science of skin color.;2;
2435;10 ways to have a better conversation;"When your job hinges on how well you talk to people, you learn a lot about how to have conversations -- and that most of us don't converse very well. Celeste Headlee has worked as a radio host for decades, and she knows the ingredients of a great conversation: Honesty, brevity, clarity and a healthy amount of listening. In this insightful talk, she shares 10 useful rules for having better conversations. ""Go out, talk to people, listen to people,"" she says. ""And, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.""";2;
2429;The brain may be able to repair itself -- with help;"Through treating everything from strokes to car accident traumas, neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch knows the brain's inability to repair itself all too well. But now, she suggests, she and her colleagues may have found the key to neural repair: Doublecortin-positive cells. Similar to stem cells, they are extremely adaptable and, when extracted from a brain, cultured and then re-injected in a lesioned area of the same brain, they can help repair and rebuild it. ""With a little help,"" Bloch says, ""the brain may be able to help itself.""";2;
2428;The problem with race-based medicine;"Social justice advocate and law scholar Dorothy Roberts has a precise and powerful message: Race-based medicine is bad medicine. Even today, many doctors still use race as a medical shortcut; they make important decisions about things like pain tolerance based on a patient's skin color instead of medical observation and measurement. In this searing talk, Roberts lays out the lingering traces of race-based medicine -- and invites us to be a part of ending it. ""It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy,"" she says, ""and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.""";2;
24306;Why do we love? A philosophical inquiry;"Ah, romantic love; beautiful and intoxicating, heart-breaking and soul-crushing... often all at the same time! If romantic love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology has discovered it yet É?? but over the course of history, some of our most respected philosophers have put forward some intriguing theories. Skye C. Cleary outlines five of these philosophical perspectives on why we love. [Directed by Avi Ofer, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Brooks Ball and Cem Misirlioglu].";2;
2427;The case for fish farming;"We're headed towards a global food crisis: Nearly 3 billion people depend on the ocean for food, and at our current rate we already take more fish from the ocean than it can naturally replace. In this fact-packed, eye-opening talk, entrepreneur and conservationist Mike Velings proposes a solution: Aquaculture, or fish farming. ""We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters,"" he says, echoing Jacques Cousteau. ""The day will come where people will demand farmed fish on their plates that's farmed well and farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less.""";2;

2423;Economic growth has stalled. Let's fix it;"Economic growth is the defining challenge of our time; without it, political and social instability rises, human progress stagnates and societies grow dimmer. But, says economist Dambisa Moyo, dogmatic capitalism isn't creating the growth we need. As she shows, in both state-sponsored and market-driven models, capitalism is failing to solve social ills, fostering corruption and creating income inequality. Moyo surveys the current economic landscape and suggests that we have to start thinking about capitalism as a spectrum so we can blend the best of different models together to foster growth.";2;
2426;Special Olympics let me be myself -- a champion;How much do you know about intellectual disabilities?

24303;History vs. Napoleon Bonaparte;After the French Revolution erupted in 1789, Europe was thrown into chaos. Neighboring countries' monarchs feared they would share the fate of Louis XVI and attacked the new Republic, while at home, extremism and mistrust between factions led to bloodshed. In the midst of all this conflict, Napoleon emerged. But did he save the revolution, or destroy it? Alex Gendler puts Napoleon on trial. [Directed by Brett Underhill, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
2425;How we'll fight the next deadly virus;"When Ebola broke out in March 2014, Pardis Sabeti and her team got to work sequencing the virus's genome, learning how it mutated and spread. Sabeti immediately released her research online, so virus trackers and scientists from around the world could join in the urgent fight. In this talk, she shows how open cooperation was key to halting the virus ... and to attacking the next one to come along.

2424;The boiling river of the Amazon;When Andr«∏s Ruzo was a young boy in Peru, his grandfather told him a story with an odd detail: There is a river, deep in the Amazon, which boils as if a fire burns below it. Twelve years later, after training as a geoscientist, he set out on a journey deep into the jungle of South America in search of this boiling river. At a time when everything seems mapped and measured, join Ruzo as he explores a river that forces us to question the line between known and unknown ... and reminds us that there are great wonders yet to be discovered.;2;
24301;Can you solve the temple riddle?;Your expedition finally stands at the heart of the ancient temple. But as you study the inscriptions in the darkness, two wisps of green smoke burst forth. The walls begin to shake. The giant sandglass begins flowing with less than an hour before it empties, and a rumbling tells you that you don't want to be around when that happens. Can you use math to escape the temple? Dennis E. Shasha shows how. [Directed by Artrake Studio, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
2417;A delightful way to teach kids about computers;Computer code is the next universal language, and its syntax will be limited only by the imaginations of the next generation of programmers. Linda Liukas is helping to educate problem-solving kids, encouraging them to see computers not as mechanical, boring and complicated but as colorful, expressive machines meant to be tinkered with. In this talk, she invites us to imagine a world where the Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow grow up to be optimistic and brave about technology and use it to create a new world that is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird.;2;
2418;Our campaign to ban plastic bags in Bali;"Plastic bags are essentially indestructible, yet they're used and thrown away with reckless abandon. Most end up in the ocean, where they pollute the water and harm marine life; the rest are burned in garbage piles, where they release harmful dioxins into the atmosphere. Melati and Isabel Wijsen are on a mission to stop plastic bags from suffocating their beautiful island home of Bali. Their efforts -- including petitions, beach cleanups, even a hunger strike -- paid off when they convinced their governor to commit to a plastic bag-free Bali by 2018. ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you're too young or you won't understand,"" Isabel says to other aspiring activists. ""We're not telling you it's going to be easy. We're telling you it's going to be worth it.""";2;
2419;A robot that runs and swims like a salamander;Roboticist Auke Ijspeert designs biorobots, machines modeled after real animals that are capable of handling complex terrain and would appear at home in the pages of a sci-fi novel. The process of creating these robots leads to better automata that can be used for fieldwork, service, and search and rescue. But these robots don't just mimic the natural world -- they help us understand our own biology better, unlocking previously unknown secrets of the spinal cord.;2;
2416;Should you be able to patent a human gene?;A decade ago, US law said human genes were patentable -- which meant patent holders had the right to stop anyone from sequencing, testing or even looking at a patented gene. Troubled by the way this law both harmed patients and created a barrier to biomedical innovation, Tania Simoncelli and her colleagues at the ACLU challenged it. In this riveting talk, hear the story of how they took a case everybody told them they would lose all the way to the Supreme Court.;2;
24298;Why are human bodies asymmetrical?;Symmetry is everywhere in nature. And we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf or a butterfly with intricate patterns mirrored on each wing. But it turns out that asymmetry is pretty important, too É?? and more common than you might think. Leo Q. Wan takes us into the human body to show how biological asymmetry can be quite beautiful. [Directed by Echo Bridge Pictures, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;

Join his journey in search of biofluorescent sharks, seahorses, sea turtles and more, and learn how these light-up creatures could illuminate a new understanding of our own brains.;2;
2413;Capitalism will eat democracy -- unless we speak up;"Have you wondered why politicians aren't what they used to be, why governments seem unable to solve real problems? Economist Yanis Varoufakis, the former Minister of Finance for Greece, says that it's because you can be in politics today but not be in power -- because real power now belongs to those who control the economy. He believes that the mega-rich and corporations are cannibalizing the political sphere, causing financial crisis. In this talk, hear his dream for a world in which capital and labor no longer struggle against each other, ""one that is simultaneously libertarian, Marxist and Keynesian.""";2;
2415;The unheard story of the Sistine Chapel;"The Sistine Chapel is one of the most iconic buildings on earth -- but there's a lot you probably don't know about it. In this tour-de-force talk, art historian Elizabeth Lev guides us across the famous building's ceiling and Michelangelo's vital depiction of traditional stories, showing how the painter reached beyond the religious iconography of the time to chart new artistic waters. Five hundred years after the artist painted it, says Lev, the Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror and ask, ""Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?""";2;
2407;How I turned a deadly plant into a thriving business;The water hyacinth may look like a harmless, even beautiful flowering plant -- but it's actually an invasive aquatic weed that clogs waterways, stopping trade, interrupting schooling and disrupting everyday life. In this scourge, green entrepreneur Achenyo Idachaba saw opportunity. Follow her journey as she turns weeds into woven wonders.;2;
2411;Can a computer write poetry?;If you read a poem and feel moved by it, but then find out it was actually written by a computer, would you feel differently about the experience? Would you think that the computer had expressed itself and been creative, or would you feel like you had fallen for a cheap trick? In this talk, writer Oscar Schwartz examines why we react so strongly to the idea of a computer writing poetry -- and how this reaction helps us understand what it means to be human.;2;
2412;How we can make crops survive without water;"As the world's population grows and the effects of climate change come into sharper relief, we'll have to feed more people using less arable land. Molecular biologist Jill Farrant studies a rare phenomenon that may help: ""resurrection plants"" -- super-resilient plants that seemingly come back from the dead. Could they hold promise for growing food in our coming hotter, drier world?";2;

24295;How statistics can be misleading;Statistics are persuasive. So much so that people, organizations, and whole countries base some of their most important decisions on organized data. But any set of statistics might have something lurking inside it that can turn the results completely upside down. Mark Liddell investigates Simpson's paradox. [Directed by Mike Foster and Tom Sanders, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
2375;Why great architecture should tell a story;For architect Ole Scheeren, the people who live and work inside a building are as much a part of that building as concrete, steel and glass. He asks: Can architecture be about collaboration and storytelling instead of the isolation and hierarchy of a typical skyscraper? Visit five of Scheeren's buildings -- from a twisted tower in China to a floating cinema in the ocean in Thailand -- and learn the stories behind them.;2;
2400;Let's design social media that drives real change;Wael Ghonim helped touch off the Arab Spring in his home of Egypt ... by setting up a simple Facebook page. As he reveals, once the revolution spilled onto the streets, it turned from hopeful to messy, then ugly and heartbreaking. And social media followed suit. What was once a place for crowdsourcing, engaging and sharing became a polarized battleground. Ghonim asks: What can we do about online behavior now? How can we use the Internet and social media to create civility and reasoned argument?;2;
2406;I love being a police officer, but we need reform;"We've invested so much in police departments as protectors that we have forgotten what it means to serve our communities, says Baltimore Police officer Lt. Colonel Melvin Russell. It's led to coldness and callousness, and it's dehumanized the police force. After taking over as district commander in one of Baltimore's toughest neighborhoods, Russell instituted a series of reforms aimed at winning back the trust of the community and lowering the violent crime rate. ""Law enforcement is in a crisis,"" he says. ""But it's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again.""";2;
24293;How do carbohydrates impact your health?;The things we eat and drink on a daily basis can impact our health in big ways. Too many carbohydrates, for instance, can lead to insulin resistance, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease and Type 2 Diabetes. But what are carbs, exactly? And what do they do to our bodies? Richard J. Wood explains. [Directed by Qa'ed Mai, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;

As the director of a 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction. In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life.;2;
24289;The science of snowflakes;One could say that snowflakes are simply frozen water É?? but if you compare a snowflake to an ice cube, you'll notice a big difference. Why are all snowflakes six-sided? Why are none of them exactly the same? And how do we ski on them? Maruè≠a Bradaéç sheds light on the secret life of snowflakes. [Directed by Lucas Millard & Kate Stryker, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Seth S. Scott].;2;
2395;An underwater art museum, teeming with life;For sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor, the ocean is more than a muse -- it's an exhibition space and museum. Taylor creates sculptures of human forms and mundane life on land and sinks them to the ocean floor, where they are subsumed by the sea and transformed from lifeless stone into vibrant habitats for corals, crustaceans and other creatures. The result: Enigmatic, haunting and colorful commentaries about our transient existence, the sacredness of the ocean and its breathtaking power of regeneration.;2;
2398;Governments don't understand cyber warfare. We need hackers;"The Internet has transformed the front lines of war, and it's leaving governments behind. As security analyst Rodrigo Bijou shows, modern conflict is being waged online between non-state groups, activists and private corporations, and the digital landscape is proving to be fertile ground for the recruitment and radicalization of terrorists. Meanwhile, draconian surveillance programs are ripe for exploitation. Bijou urges governments to end mass surveillance programs and shut ""backdoors"" -- and he makes a bold call for individuals to step up.";2;
2397;Refugees have the right to be protected;Ant«¸nio Guterres thinks that we can solve the global refugee crisis -- and he offers compelling, surprising reasons why we must try. In conversation with TED's Bruno Giussani, Guterres discusses the historical causes of the current crisis and outlines the mood of the European countries that are trying to screen, shelter and resettle hundreds of thousands of desperate families. Bigger picture: Guterres calls for a multilateral turn toward acceptance and respect -- to defy groups like ISIS's anti-refugee propaganda and recruiting machine.;2;
2394;A hilarious celebration of lifelong female friendship;"Legendary duo Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin have been friends for decades. In a raw, tender and wide-ranging conversation hosted by Pat Mitchell, the three discuss longevity, feminism, the differences between male and female friendship, what it means to live well and women's role in future of our planet.

24286;What is depression?;"Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world; in the United States, close to ten percent of adults struggle with the disease. But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand than, say, high cholesterol. Helen M. Farrell examines the symptoms and treatments of depression, and gives some tips for how you might help a friend who is suffering. [Directed by Artrake Studio, narrated by Addison Anderson].";2;
2227;Let's not use Mars as a backup planet;"Stellar astronomer and TED Senior Fellow Lucianne Walkowicz works on NASA's Kepler mission, searching for places in the universe that could support life. So it's worth a listen when she asks us to think carefully about Mars. In this short talk, she suggests that we stop dreaming of Mars as a place that we'll eventually move to when we've messed up Earth, and to start thinking of planetary exploration and preservation of the Earth as two sides of the same goal. As she says, ""The more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet.""";2;
2389;The four fish we're overeating -- and what to eat instead;The way we fish for popular seafood such as salmon, tuna and shrimp is threatening to ruin our oceans.

[Directed by Cinematic, narrated by Addison Anderson]. ;2;
2383;How new technology helps blind people explore the world;How can technology help improve our quality of life? How can we navigate the world without using the sense of vision? Inventor and IBM Fellow Chieko Asakawa, who's been blind since the age of fourteen, is working on answering these questions. In a charming demo, she shows off some new technology that's helping blind people explore the world ever more independently ... because, she suggests, when we design for greater accessibility, everyone benefits.;2;8
2384;The US needs paid family leave -- for the sake of its future;We need women to work, and we need working women to have babies. So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents.;2;
2385;How we're growing baby corals to rebuild reefs;"Kristen Marhaver studies corals, tiny creatures the size of a poppyseed that, over hundreds of slow years, create beautiful, life-sustaining ocean structures hundreds of miles long. As she admits, it's easy to get sad about the state of coral reefs; they're in the news lately because of how quickly they're bleaching, dying and turning to slime. But the good news is that we're learning more and more about these amazing marine invertebrates -- including how to help them (and help them help us). This biologist and TED Senior Fellow offers a glimpse into the wonderful and mysterious lives of these hard-working and fragile creatures.";2;
24281;"Can you solve ""Einstein's Riddle""?";Before he turned physics upside down, a young Albert Einstein supposedly showed off his genius by devising a complex riddle involving a stolen exotic fish and a long list of suspects.

2381;An art made of trust, vulnerability and connection;"Marina Abramovié?'s art pushes the boundary between audience and artist in pursuit of heightened consciousness and personal change. In her groundbreaking 2010 work, ""The Artist Is Present,"" she simply sat in a chair facing her audience, for eight hours a day ... with powerfully moving results. Her boldest work may still be yet to come -- it's taking the form of a sprawling art institute devoted to experimentation and simple acts done with mindful attention. ""Nothing happens if you always do things the same way,"" she says. ""My method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I don't know, to go to territory that nobody's ever been.""";2;
2380;Why the best hire might not have the perfect resume;"Given the choice between a job candidate with a perfect resume and one who has fought through difficulty, human resources executive Regina Hartley always gives the ""Scrapper"" a chance.

""Choose the underestimated contender, whose secret weapons are passion and purpose,"" she says. ""Hire the Scrapper.""";2;24
2382;My year reading a book from every country in the world;"Ann Morgan considered herself well read -- until she discovered the ""massive blindspot"" on her bookshelf. Amid a multitude of English and American authors, there were very few books from beyond the English-speaking world. So she set an ambitious goal: to read one book from every country in the world over the course of a year. Now she's urging other Anglophiles to read translated works so that publishers will work harder to bring foreign literary gems back to their shores. Explore interactive maps of her reading journey here: go.ted.com/readtheworld";2;
2377;Why are these 32 symbols found in ancient caves all over Europe?;Written language, the hallmark of human civilization, didn't just suddenly appear one day. Thousands of years before the first fully developed writing systems, our ancestors scrawled geometric signs across the walls of the caves they sheltered in. Paleoanthropologist, rock art researcher and TED Senior Fellow Genevieve von Petzinger has studied and codified these ancient markings in caves across Europe. The uniformity of her findings suggest that graphic communication, and the ability to preserve and transmit messages beyond a single moment in time, may be much older than we think.;2;
2373;What are animals thinking and feeling?;What's going on inside the brains of animals? Can we know what, or if, they're thinking and feeling? Carl Safina thinks we can. Using discoveries and anecdotes that span ecology, biology and behavioral science, he weaves together stories of whales, wolves, elephants and albatrosses to argue that just as we think, feel, use tools and express emotions, so too do the other creatures É?? and minds É?? that share the Earth with us.;2;
2379;My country will be underwater soon -- unless we work together;"For the people of Kiribati, climate change isn't something to be debated, denied or legislated against -- it's an everyday reality. The low-lying Pacific island nation may soon be underwater, thanks to rising sea levels. In a personal conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Kiribati President Anote Tong discusses his country's present climate catastrophe and its imperiled future.

In this talk, he takes us on a journey into this complicated, unregulated market and imagines how it could be a model for a stock market for commerce.";2;8
2374;The chilling aftershock of a brush with death;"In April 2003, just as American troops began rolling into Baghdad, a shell smashed into the building author and war correspondent Jean-Paul Mari was reporting from. There he had a face-to-face encounter with death, beginning his acquaintance with a phantom that has haunted those who have risked their lives on battlefields since ancient times. ""What is this thing that can kill you without leaving any visible scars?"" Mari asks. We know it as post-traumatic stress disorder -- or, as Mari describes it, an experience with the void of death. In this probing talk, he searches for answers to questions about mortality and psychosis and in the aftermath of horror and trauma.";4;

[Directed by TED-Ed, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Carlos Palomares].;2;
2372;How I'm working for change inside my church;"How do we respect someone's religious beliefs, while also holding religion accountable for the damage those beliefs may cause? Chelsea Shields has a bold answer to this question. She was raised in the orthodox Mormon tradition, and she spent the early part of her life watching women be excluded from positions of importance within the LDS Church. Now, this anthropologist, activist and TED Fellow is working to reform her church's institutionalized gender inequality. ""Religions can liberate or subjugate, they can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy,"" she says. ""What is taught on the Sabbath leaks into our politics, our health policy, violence around the world.""";2;
2369;The moral bias behind your search results;Search engines have become our most trusted sources of information and arbiters of truth. But can we ever get an unbiased search result? Swedish author and journalist Andreas Ekstr«Ùm argues that such a thing is a philosophical impossibility. In this thoughtful talk, he calls on us to strengthen the bonds between technology and the humanities, and he reminds us that behind every algorithm is a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate.;2;
24275;How stress affects your brain;"Stress isn't always a bad thing; it can be handy for a burst of extra energy and focus, like when you're playing a competitive sport or have to speak in public. But when it's continuous, it actually begins to change your brain. Madhumita Murgia shows how chronic stress can affect brain size, its structure, and how it functions, right down to the level of your genes. [Directed by Andrew Zimbelman, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Josh Smoak]. ";2;
2370;This is what LGBT life is like around the world;"As a gay couple in San Francisco, Jenni Chang and Lisa Dazols had a relatively easy time living the way they wanted. But outside the bubble of the Bay Area, what was life like for people still lacking basic rights?

2367;The coolest animal you know nothing about ... and how we can save it;"Although the tapir is one of the world's largest land mammals, the lives of these solitary, nocturnal creatures have remained a mystery. Known as ""the living fossil,"" the very same tapir that roams the forests and grasslands of South America today arrived on the evolutionary scene more than 5 million years ago. But threats from poachers, deforestation and pollution, especially in quickly industrializing Brazil, threaten this longevity. In this insightful talk, conservation biologist, tapir expert and TED Fellow Patr«cia Medici shares her work with these amazing animals and challenges us with a question: Do we want to be responsible for their extinction?";2;
24273;What makes muscles grow?;We have over 600 muscles in our bodies that help bind us together, hold us up, and help us move.

13025;The global business next door;"When you think ""global company,"" what do you imagine? A massive conglomerate? A far-reaching tech corporation? Scott Szwast reveals that our image of the global business is wrong É?? 98% of US exporters are in fact companies with less than fifty employees. And yet, this only includes 1% of all US businesses. He explains why so many companies hesitate to leap across the border - and why they need to make the jump.";2;24
13024;Taking trash talk to a whole new level;"Dealing with the waste of a consumer society is one of the greatest challenges of our modern times. But UPS' Sustainability Director, Peter Harris wonders: what if waste weren't waste at all?

2361;How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed;"You're not at your best when you're stressed. In fact, your brain has evolved over millennia to release cortisol in stressful situations, inhibiting rational, logical thinking but potentially helping you survive, say, being attacked by a lion. Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin thinks there's a way to avoid making critical mistakes in stressful situations, when your thinking becomes clouded -- the pre-mortem. ""We all are going to fail now and then,"" he says. ""The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be.""";2;

2365;Art that lets you talk back to NSA spies;In 2013, the world learned that the NSA and its UK equivalent, GCHQ, routinely spied on the German government. Amid the outrage, artists Mathias Jud and Christoph Wachter thought: Well, if they're listening ... let's talk to them. With antennas mounted on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin's government district, they set up an open network that let the world send messages to US and UK spies listening nearby. It's one of three bold, often funny, and frankly subversive works detailed in this talk, which highlights the world's growing discontent with surveillance and closed networks.;2;
2357;The enchanting music of sign language;Artist and TED Fellow Christine Sun Kim was born deaf, and she was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of her life, that it was a hearing person's thing. Through her art, she discovered similarities between American Sign Language and music, and she realized that sound doesn't have to be known solely through the ears -- it can be felt, seen and experienced as an idea. In this endearing talk, she invites us to open our eyes and ears and participate in the rich treasure of visual language.;2;
2363;How I teach kids to love science;"At the Harbour School in Hong Kong, TED Senior Fellow Cesar Harada teaches citizen science and invention to the next generation of environmentalists.

24269;How computers translate human language;Is a universal translator possible in real life? We already have many programs that claim to be able to take a word, sentence, or entire book in one language and translate it into almost any other. The reality, however, is a bit more complicated. Ioannis Papachimonas shows how these machine translators work, and explains why they often get a bit mixed up. [Directed by Peyton Skyler, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
2364;Social services are broken. How we can fix them;When a family falls into crisis -- and it sometimes happens, thanks to unemployment, drugs, bad relationships and bad luck -- the social services system is supposed to step in and help them get back on track. As Hilary Cottam shows, in the UK a typical family in crisis can be eligible for services from more than 70 different agencies, but it's unlikely that any one of them can really make a difference. Cottam, a social entrepreneur herself, asks us to think about the ways we solve deep and complex social problems. How can we build supportive, enthusiastic relationships between those in need and those that provide help?;2;
2359;Deep under the Earth's surface, discovering beauty and science;Cave explorer and geologist Francesco Sauro travels to the hidden continent under our feet, surveying deep, dark places inside the earth that humans have never been able to reach before.

2353;Two nameless bodies washed up on the beach. Here are their stories;"When two bodies wearing identical wetsuits washed ashore in Norway and the Netherlands, journalist Anders Fjellberg and photographer Tomm Christiansen started a search to answer the question: who were these people? What they found and reported in Norway's ""Dagbladet"" is that everybody has a name, everybody has a story and everybody is someone.";2;
2349;Why medicine often has dangerous side effects for women;"You might not know this: Many of the medicines we take -- common drugs like Ambien and everyday aspirin -- were only ever tested on men. And the unknown side effects for women can be dangerous, even deadly. Alyson McGregor studies the differences between male and female patients; in this fascinating talk she explains how the male model became our framework for medical research ... and what women and men need to ask their doctors to get the right care for their bodies.";2;

He explores the many ways this manufacturing revolution will impact the economy, and what kinds of other jobs this new chapter will create.;2;1
5148;Reinventing creative thinking ;Thinking out of the box -- it's one of the most cited strategies for innovation. Corporate philosopher Luc de Brabandere pondered exactly what was happening in our minds when we think creatively, and shares his own perspective on this strategy. He argues that the most incredible ideas don't come from just thinking beyond the perimeter of our current perception, but from relocating our minds to an entirely different box where preconceived ideas don't limit imagination.;2;1

2314;How to avoid surveillance ... with the phone in your pocket;Who is listening in on your phone calls? On a landline, it could be anyone, says privacy activist Christopher Soghoian, because surveillance backdoors are built into the phone system by default, to allow governments to listen in. But then again, so could a foreign intelligence service ... or a criminal. Which is why, says Soghoian, some tech companies are resisting governments' call to build the same backdoors into mobile phones and new messaging systems. From this TED Fellow, learn how some tech companies are working to keep your calls and messages private.;2;

Infographics expert Manuel Lima explores the thousand-year history of mapping data -- from languages to dynasties -- using trees and networks of information. It's a fascinating history of visualizations, and a look into humanity's urge to map what we know.";2;
2310;How I learned to communicate my inner life with Asperger's;Alix Generous is a young woman with a million and one ideas -- she's done award-winning science, helped develop new technology and tells a darn good joke (you'll see).

Learn how he built a secret monument to place these names in the official record.;2;
24240;Who am I? A philosophical inquiry;Throughout the history of mankind, the subject of identity has sent poets to the blank page, philosophers to the agora and seekers to the oracles.

Amy Adkins illuminates Plutarch's Ship of Theseus. [Directed by Stretch Films, Inc., narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;

2309;The surprising way groups like ISIS stay in power;ISIS, Hezbollah, Hamas. These three very different groups are known for violence É?? but thatÉ??s only a portion of what they do, says policy analyst Benedetta Berti. They also attempt to win over populations with social work: setting up schools and hospitals, offering safety and security, and filling the gaps left by weak governments. Understanding the broader work of these groups suggests new strategies for ending the violence.;2;
24238;The benefits of good posture;"Has anyone ever told you, ""Stand up straight!"" or scolded you for slouching at a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoyingÉ??but they're not wrong. Your posture is the foundation for every movement your body makes and can determine how well your body adapts to the stresses on it. Murat Dalkilin«ı gives the pros of good posture. [Directed by Nadav Arbel, narrated by Addison Anderson].";2;
2307;What explains the rise of humans?;"Seventy thousand years ago, our human ancestors were insignificant animals, just minding their own business in a corner of Africa with all the other animals. But now, few would disagree that humans dominate planet Earth; we've spread to every continent, and our actions determine the fate of other animals (and possibly Earth itself). How did we get from there to here? Historian Yuval Noah Harari suggests a surprising reason for the rise of humanity.";2;

2298;What my religion really says about women;Strong faith is a core part of Alaa Murabit's identity -- but when she moved from Canada to Libya as a young woman, she was surprised how the tenets of Islam were used to severely limit women's rights, independence and ability to lead. She wondered: Was this really religious doctrine? With humor, passion and a refreshingly rebellious spirt, she shares how she found examples of female leaders across the history of her faith É?? and how she speaks up for women using verses from the Koran.;2;
2302;When online shaming goes too far;Twitter gives a voice to the voiceless, a way to speak up and hit back at perceived injustice. But sometimes, says Jon Ronson, things go too far.

This sometimes meant medical advice, and it sometimes meant art, music, emotional support -- from more than half a million people.";2;
2300;This is what enduring love looks like;Stacey Baker has always been obsessed with how couples meet. When she asked photographer Alec Soth to help her explore this topic, they found themselves at the world's largest speed-dating event, held in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day, and at the largest retirement community in Nevada É?? with Soth taking portraits of pairs in each locale.

(This talk was part of a TED2015 session curated by Pop-Up Magazine: popupmagazine.com or @popupmag on Twitter.);2;
2297;A better way to talk about abortion;"Abortion is extremely common. In America, for example, one in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime, yet the strong emotions sparked by the topic -- and the highly politicized rhetoric around it -- leave little room for thoughtful, open debate. In this personal, thoughtful talk, Aspen Baker makes the case for being neither É??pro-lifeÉ?ù nor É??pro-choiceÉ?ù but rather ""pro-voice"" -- and for the roles that listening and storytelling can play when it comes to discussing difficult topics.";2;
24230;What is a calorie?;We hear about calories all the time: How many calories are in this cookie? How many are burned by doing 100 jumping jacks, or long-distance running, or fidgeting?

2289;What do we do when antibiotics don't work any more?;Penicillin changed everything. Infections that had previously killed were suddenly quickly curable. Yet as Maryn McKenna shares in this sobering talk, we've squandered the advantages afforded us by that and later antibiotics. Drug-resistant bacteria mean we're entering a post-antibiotic world -- and it won't be pretty. There are, however, things we can do ... if we start right now.;2;
6857;The benefits of a bilingual brain;It's obvious that knowing more than one language can make certain things easier -- like traveling or watching movies without subtitles.

In this short, powerful talk, the TED Fellow shares a deeply personal glimpse of an often-unseen world.";2;
2286;The forgotten history of autism;Decades ago, few pediatricians had heard of autism. In 1975, 1 in 5,000 kids was estimated to have it. Today, 1 in 68 is on the autism spectrum. What caused this steep rise? Steve Silberman points to É??a perfect storm of autism awarenessÉ?ù É?? a pair of psychologists with an accepting view, an unexpected pop culture moment and a new clinical test. But to really understand, we have to go back further to an Austrian doctor by the name of Hans Asperger, who published a pioneering paper in 1944.

[Directed by Artrake Studio, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
2283;Forget the pecking order at work;"Organizations are often run according to ""the superchicken model,"" where the value is placed on star employees who outperform others. And yet, this isn't what drives the most high-achieving teams. Business leader Margaret Heffernan observes that it is social cohesion É?? built every coffee break, every time one team member asks another for help É?? that leads over time to great results. It's a radical rethink of what drives us to do our best work, and what it means to be a leader. Because as Heffernan points out: ""Companies don't have ideas. Only people do.""";2;
24219;"Football physics: The ""impossible"" free kick";In 1997, Brazilian football player Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick with no direct line to the goal.

Sarthak Sinha takes us past the epidermis and into the dermis to investigate this regenerative response. ;2;
2132;The coming crisis in antibiotics;Antibiotic drugs save lives. But we simply use them too much É?? and often for non-lifesaving purposes, like treating the flu and even raising cheaper chickens. The result, says researcher Ramanan Laxminarayan, is that the drugs will stop working for everyone, as the bacteria they target grow more and more resistant. He calls on all of us (patients and  doctors alike) to think of antibiotics -- and their ongoing effectiveness -- as a finite resource, and to think twice before we tap into it.

2119;A flying camera ... on a leash;Let's admit it: aerial photo drones and UAVs are a little creepy, and they come with big regulatory and safety problems.

Sergei Lupashin demos Fotokite, a nifty new way to see the world from on high, safely and under control.;2;

2103;One more reason to get a good night's sleep;The brain uses a quarter of the body's entire energy supply, yet only accounts for about two percent of the body's mass.

1949;My wish: To launch a new era of openness in business;Anonymous companies protect corrupt individuals É?? from notorious drug cartel leaders to nefarious arms dealers É?? behind a shroud of mystery that makes it almost impossible to find and hold them responsible. But anti-corruption activist Charmian Gooch hopes to change all that. At TED2014, she shares her brave TED Prize wish: to know who owns and controls companies, to change the law, and to launch a new era of openness in business.;2;
1951;What I learned from going blind in space;There's an astronaut saying: In space, É??there is no problem so bad that you canÉ??t make it worse.É?ù So how do you deal with the complexity, the sheer pressure, of dealing with dangerous and scary situations?

Watch for a special space-y performance.;2;
1950;Here's how we take back the Internet;"Appearing by telepresence robot, Edward Snowden speaks at TED2014 about surveillance and Internet freedom. The right to data privacy, he suggests, is not a partisan issue, but requires a fundamental rethink of the role of the internet in our lives É?? and the laws that protect it. ""Your rights matter,"" he says, ""because you never know when you're going to need them."" Chris Anderson interviews, with special guest Tim Berners-Lee.";2;
24044;The case of the vanishing honeybees;In the past decade, the US honeybee population has been decreasing at an alarming and unprecedented rate. While this is obviously bad news for honeypots everywhere, bees also help feed us in a bigger way -- by pollinating our nation's crops. Emma Bryce investigates potential causes for this widespread colony collapse disorder. [Directed by Lillian Chan, narrated by Derek Gebhart, music by John Poon].;2;
1946;The neuroscience of restorative justice;Dan Reisel studies the biology of change, including our ability to rewire our own brains. And he asks a big question: Instead of warehousing these criminals, shouldn't we be using what we know about the brain to help them rehabilitate? Put another way: If the brain can grow new neural pathways after an injury ... could we help the brain re-grow morality?;2;
1948;The long reach of reason;Here's a TED first: an animated Socratic dialog! In a time when irrationality seems to rule both politics and culture, has reasoned thinking finally lost its power? Watch as psychologist Steven Pinker is gradually, brilliantly persuaded by philosopher Rebecca Newberger Goldstein that reason is actually the key driver of human moral progress, even if its effect sometimes takes generations to unfold. The dialog was recorded live at TED, and animated, in incredible, often hilarious, detail by Cognitive.;2;
1945;The birds and the bees are just the beginning;Think you know a thing or two about sex? Think again. In this fascinating talk, biologist Carin Bondar lays out the surprising science behind how animals get it on. (This talk describes explicit and aggressive sexual content.);2;
1944;You don't need an app for that;Are the simplest phones the smartest? While the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs, says journalist Toby Shapshak.

[Directed by Flaming Medusa Studios Inc., narrated by Rose Eveleth].;2;
1934;A word game to communicate in any language;"While working with kids who have trouble speaking, Ajit Narayanan sketched out a way to think about language in pictures, to relate words and concepts in ""maps."" The idea now powers the FreeSpeech app, which can help nonverbal people communicate.";2;
1941;A 50-cent microscope that folds like origami;Perhaps youÉ??ve punched out a paper doll or folded an origami swan? TED Fellow Manu Prakash and his team have created a microscope made of paper that's just as easy to fold and use. A sparkling demo that shows how this invention could revolutionize healthcare in developing countries É?› and turn almost anything into a fun, hands-on science experiment.;2;
1942;My DNA vending machine;Vending machines generally offer up sodas, candy bars and chips. Not so for the one created by TED Fellow Gabe Barcia-Colombo. This artist has dreamed up a DNA Vending Machine, which dispenses extracted human DNA, packaged in a vial along with a collectible photo of the person who gave it. ItÉ??s charming and quirky, but points out larger ethical issues that will arise as access to biotechnology increases.;2;
1940;Government surveillance É?? this is just the beginning;Privacy researcher Christopher Soghoian sees the landscape of government surveillance shifting beneath our feet, as an industry grows to support monitoring programs.

This TED Fellow gives an unsettling look at what's to come.;2;
1938;How data will transform business;What does the future of business look like? In an informative talk, Philip Evans gives a quick primer on two long-standing theories in strategy -- and explains why he thinks they are essentially invalid.;2;1
1939;Could future devices read images from our brains?;As an expert on cutting-edge digital displays, Mary Lou Jepsen studies how to show our most creative ideas on screens. And as a brain surgery patient herself, she is driven to know more about the neural activity that underlies invention, creativity, thought. She meshes these two passions in a rather mind-blowing talk on two cutting-edge brain studies that might point to a new frontier in understanding how (and what) we think.;2;
1937;The 3 agencies with the power to make or break economies;The way we rate national economies is all wrong, says rating agency reformer Annette Heuser. With mysterious and obscure methods, three private US-based credit rating agencies wield immense power over national economies across the globe, and the outcomes can be catastrophic. But what if there was another way? In this bold talk, Heuser shares her vision for a nonprofit agency that would bring more equality and justice into the mix.;2;
1936;What we can learn from galaxies far, far away;In a fun, exciting talk, teenager Henry Lin looks at something unexpected in the sky: distant galaxy clusters.

24036;Why do we cry? The three types of tears;Whether we cry during a sad movie, while chopping onions, or completely involuntarily, our eyes are constantly producing tears. Alex Gendler tracks a particularly watery day in the life of Iris (the iris) as she cycles through basal, reflex and emotional tears. [Directed by The Moving Company Animation Studio, narrated by Addison Anderson]. ;2;
1929;We need money for aid. So letÉ??s print it.;During the financial crisis, the central banks of the United States, United Kingdom and Japan created $3.7 trillion in order to buy assets and encourage investors to do the same. Michael Metcalfe offers a shocking idea: could these same central banks print money to ensure they stay on track with their goals for global aid? Without risking inflation?;2;15
24035;What is the universe made of?;The atoms around you have existed for billions of years -- and most originated in the flaming, gaseous core of a star. Dennis Wildfogel tells the captivating tale of these atoms' long journeys from the Big Bang to the molecules they form today. [Directed by Pew36 Animation Studios, narrated by Dennis Wildfogel].;2;
1933;Why good hackers make good citizens;Hacking is about more than mischief-making or political subversion. As Catherine Bracy describes in this spirited talk, it can be just as much a force for good as it is for evil. She spins through some inspiring civically-minded projects in Honolulu, Oakland and Mexico City É?? and makes a compelling case that we all have what it takes to get involved.;2;
1935;Can the damaged brain repair itself?;After a traumatic brain injury, it sometimes happens that the brain can repair itself, building new brain cells to replace damaged ones. But the repair doesn't happen quickly enough to allow recovery from degenerative conditions like motor neuron disease (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS). Siddharthan Chandran walks through some new techniques using special stem cells that could allow the damaged brain to rebuild faster.;2;
1932;We're all hiding something. Let's find the courage to open up;In this touching talk, Ash Beckham offers a fresh approach to empathy and openness. It starts with understanding that everyone, at some point in their life, has experienced hardship. The only way out, says Beckham, is to open the door and step out of your closet.;2;
1931;Are we designed to be sexual omnivores?;An idea permeates our modern view of relationships: that men and women have always paired off in sexually exclusive relationships. But before the dawn of agriculture, humans may actually have been quite promiscuous. Author Christopher Ryan walks us through the controversial evidence that human beings are sexual omnivores by nature, in hopes that a more nuanced understanding may put an end to discrimination, shame and the kind of unrealistic expectations that kill relationships.;2;
1930;What it takes to be a great leader;The world is full of leadership programs, but the best way to learn how to lead might be right under your nose. In this clear, candid talk, Roselinde Torres describes 25 years observing truly great leaders at work, and shares the three simple but crucial questions would-be company chiefs need to ask to thrive in the future.;2;1
24033;An athlete uses physics to shatter world records;When Dick Fosbury couldn't compete against the skilled high jumpers at his college, he tried jumping in a different way -- backwards. Fosbury improved his record immediately and continued to amaze the world with his new technique all the way to Olympic gold. Asaf Bar-Yosef explains the physics behind the success of the now dominant Fosbury Flop. [Directed by NEIGHBOR, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
1845;A new way to grow bone;What does it take to regrow bone in mass quantities? Typical bone regeneration -- wherein bone is taken from a patientÉ??s hip and grafted onto damaged bone elsewhere in the body -- is limited and can cause great pain just a few years after operation. In an informative talk, Molly Stevens introduces a new stem cell application that harnesses boneÉ??s innate ability to regenerate and produces vast quantities of bone tissue painlessly.;2;
1925;Love -- you're doing it wrong;In this delightful talk, philosopher Yann Dall'Aglio explores the universal search for tenderness and connection in a world that's ever more focused on the individual. As it turns out, it's easier than you think. A wise and witty reflection on the state of love in the modern age. In French with subtitles.;4;
1928;Synthetic voices, as unique as fingerprints;Many of those with severe speech disorders use a computerized device to communicate. Yet they choose between only a few voice options. That's why Stephen Hawking has an American accent, and why many people end up with the same voice, often to incongruous effect. Speech scientist Rupal Patel wanted to do something about this, and in this wonderful talk she shares her work to engineer unique voices for the voiceless.;2;
1927;The investment logic for sustainability;"Sustainability is pretty clearly one of the world's most important goals; but what groups can really make environmental progress in leaps and bounds? Chris McKnett makes the case that it's large institutional investors. He shows how strong financial data isn't enough, and reveals why investors need to look at a company's environmental, social and governance structures, too.";2;15
1926;Paper beats plastic? How to rethink environmental folklore;Most of us want to do the right thing when it comes to the environment. But things arenÉ??t as simple as opting for the paper bag, says sustainability strategist Leyla Acaroglu. A bold call for us to let go of tightly-held green myths and think bigger in order to create systems and products that ease strain on the planet.;2;
1924;"Does the media have a ""duty of care""?";In this thoughtful talk, David Puttnam asks a big question about the media: Does it have a moral imperative to create informed citizens, to support democracy? His solution for ensuring media responsibility is bold, and you might not agree. But it's certainly a question worth asking.;2;
1921;Art that craves your attention;In this charming talk, artist Aparna Rao shows us her latest work: cool, cartoony sculptures (with neat robotic tricks underneath them) that play with your perception -- and crave your attention. Take a few minutes to simply be delighted.;2;
1922;A new equation for intelligence;Is there an equation for intelligence? Yes. It's F = T É?? Sÿ?. In a fascinating and informative talk, physicist and computer scientist Alex Wissner-Gross explains what in the world that means.;2;
1920;How architectural innovations migrate across borders;As the world's cities undergo explosive growth, inequality is intensifying. Wealthy neighborhoods and impoverished slums grow side by side, the gap between them widening. In this eye-opening talk, architect Teddy Cruz asks us to rethink urban development from the bottom up. Sharing lessons from the slums of Tijuana, Cruz explores the creative intelligence of the city's residents and offers a fresh perspective on what we can learn from places of scarcity.;2;
1919;The world is one big dataset. Now, how to photograph it ...;We're all familiar with satellite imagery, but what we might not know is that much of it is out of date. That's because satellites are big and expensive, so there aren't that many of them up in space. As he explains in this fascinating talk, Dan Berkenstock and his team came up with a different solution, designing a cheap, lightweight satellite with a radically new approach to photographing what's going on on Earth.;2;1
1918;How we turned the tide on domestic violence (Hint: the Polaroid helped);"When Esta Soler lobbied for a bill outlawing domestic violence in 1984, one politician called it the ""Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.""

24026;What percentage of your brain do you use?;Two thirds of the population believes a myth that has been propagated for over a century: that we use only 10% of our brains. Hardly! Our neuron-dense brains have evolved to use the least amount of energy while carrying the most information possible -- a feat that requires the entire brain. Richard E. Cytowic debunks this neurological myth (and explains why we aren't so good at multitasking). [Directed by TOGETHER, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
1916;Puppies! Now that IÉ??ve got your attention, complexity theory;Animal behavior isn't complicated, but it is complex. Nicolas Perony studies how individual animals -- be they Scottish Terriers, bats or meerkats -- follow simple rules that, collectively, create larger patterns of behavior. And how this complexity born of simplicity can help them adapt to new circumstances, as they arise.;2;
1915;Want to be an activist? Start with your toys;McKenna Pope's younger brother loved to cook, but he worried about using an Easy-Bake Oven -- because it was a toy for girls. So at age 13, Pope started an online petition for the American toy company Hasbro to change the pink-and-purple color scheme on the classic toy and incorporate boys into its TV marketing. In a heartening talk, Pope makes the case for gender-neutral toys and gives a rousing call to action to all kids who feel powerless.;2;
1914;Why smart statistics are the key to fighting crime;When she became the attorney general of New Jersey in 2007, Anne Milgram quickly discovered a few startling facts: not only did her team not really know who they were putting in jail, but they had no way of understanding if their decisions were actually making the public safer. And so began her ongoing, inspirational quest to bring data analytics and statistical analysis to the US criminal justice system.;2;1
24024;How fast are you moving right now?;"""How fast are you moving?"" seems like an easy question, but it's actually quite complicated -- and perhaps best answered by another question: ""Relative to what?"" Even when you think you're standing still, the Earth is moving relative to the Sun, which is moving relative to the Milky Way, which is...you get the idea. Tucker Hiatt unravels the concepts of absolute and relative speed. [Directed by Zedem Media, narrated by Addison Anderson].";2;
1913;Why massive open online courses (still) matter;2013 was a year of hype for MOOCs (massive open online courses). Great big numbers and great big hopes were followed by some disappointing first results. But the head of edX, Anant Agarwal, makes the case that MOOCs still matter -- as a way to share high-level learning widely and supplement (but perhaps not replace) traditional classrooms. Agarwal shares his vision of blended learning, where teachers create the ideal learning experience for 21st century students.;2;
1912;How I beat stage fright;Humanity's fine-tuned sense of fear served us well as a young species, giving us laser focus to avoid being eaten by competing beasts. But it's less wonderful when that same visceral, body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of 20 folk-music fans at a Tuesday night open-mic. Palms sweat, hands shake, vision blurs, and the brain says RUN: it's stage fright. In this charming, tuneful little talk, Joe Kowan talks about how he conquered it.;2;15
1911;As work gets more complex, 6 rules to simplify;"Why do people feel so miserable and disengaged at work? Because today's businesses are increasingly and dizzyingly complex -- and traditional pillars of management are obsolete, says Yves Morieux. So, he says, it falls to individual employees to navigate the rabbit's warren of interdependencies. In this energetic talk, Morieux offers six rules for ""smart simplicity."" (Rule one: Understand what your colleagues actually do.)";2;1
6069;The beauty and power of algorithms;Adaptive, intelligent and consistent, algorithms are emerging as the ultimate formula for everything from matching consumers to products to assessing medical diagnoses. Vishal Sikka shares his appreciation for the algorithm, charting both its inherent beauty and its growing power.  ;2;1
6063;The future of food;As Asian diets increasingly shift to resemble typical Western palates, the food supply chain will be challenged to keep pace with the demand. Michael Silverstein reveals the trends in motion and offers strategic ideas on how to address these obstacles. ;2;1
6061;Thriving in an overconnected world;"While email and mobile technology have greatly accelerated the way we do business, Leslie Pernow argues that the always ""on"" mentality can have a long-term detrimental effect on many organizations. In her sociological experiments at BCG and other organizations, Pernow found that if the team É??- rather than just individuals -- collectively rallies around a goal or personal value, it unleashes a process that creates better work and better lives.";2;1
6059;Using the Super Bowl to give back;The Super Bowl is one of the biggest sports, cultural and media events of the year in the US.

6027;Reigniting creativity in business;Creativity has never been more essential to competitiveness in the business world, but the critical approach to practical originality in organizations is often lacking. Alan Iny offers a key to think outside the box: apply doubt to the very models and philosophies that make up the box itself.;2;1
6292;Collective cooperation in the social sector;Wendy Woods reveals the powerful impact of collective cooperation in the social sector. Using examples of different NGOs, each one working independently to eradicate malaria, she explains how an individualistic approach reduced their efforts and resulted in fatal inefficiencies -- and what happened when they finally aligned their overall mission.;2;1
1910;His and hers ... health care;Every cell in the human body has a sex, which means that men and women are different right down to the cellular level. Yet too often, research and medicine ignore this insight -- and the often startlingly different ways in which the two sexes respond to disease or treatment. As pioneering doctor Paula Johnson describes in this thought-provoking talk, lumping everyone in together means we essentially leave women's health to chance. It's time to rethink.;2;
1909;A little-told tale of sex and sensuality;"É??If you really want to know a people, start by looking inside their bedrooms,"" says Shereen El Feki, who traveled through the Middle East for five years, talking to people about sex. While those conversations reflected rigid norms and deep repression, El Feki also discovered that sexual conservatism in the Arab world is a relatively new thing.

24021;The Infinite Hotel Paradox;The Infinite Hotel, a thought experiment created by German mathematician David Hilbert, is a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. Easy to comprehend, right? Wrong. What if it's completely booked but one person wants to check in? What about 40? Or an infinitely full bus of people? Jeff Dekofsky solves these heady lodging issues using Hilbert's paradox. [Directed by The Moving Company Animation Studio, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
1907;"How I learned to stop worrying and love ""useless"" art";"Luke Syson was a curator of Renaissance art, of transcendent paintings of saints and solemn Italian ladies -- Very Serious Art.

1900;Why dieting doesn't usually work;In the US, 80% of girls have been on a diet by the time they're 10 years old. In this honest, raw talk, neuroscientist Sandra Aamodt uses her personal story to frame an important lesson about how our brains manage our bodies, as she explores the science behind why dieting not only doesn't work, but is likely to do more harm than good. She suggests ideas for how to live a less diet-obsessed life, intuitively.;2;
2747;How sugar affects the brain;When you eat something loaded with sugar, your taste buds, your gut and your brain all take notice. This activation of your reward system is not unlike how bodies process addictive substances such as alcohol or nicotine -- an overload of sugar spikes dopamine levels and leaves you craving more. Nicole Avena explains why sweets and treats should be enjoyed in moderation. [Directed by STK Films, narrated by Michelle Snow, music by Michael Dow].;2;
1901;A bold new way to fund drug research;"Believe it or not, about 20 years' worth of potentially life-saving drugs are sitting in labs right now, untested. Why? Because they can't get the funding to go to trials; the financial risk is too high. Roger Stein is a finance guy, and he thinks deeply about mitigating risk. He and some colleagues at MIT came up with a promising new financial model that could move hundreds of drugs into the testing pipeline.";2;15
1803;Don't kill your language;"More and more, English is a global language; speaking it is perceived as a sign of being modern. But -- what do we lose when we leave behind our mother tongues?

[Directed by Igor Coric, narrated by Rose Eveleth].;2;
1895;The $80 prosthetic knee that's changing lives;We've made incredible advances in technology in recent years, but too often it seems only certain fortunate people can benefit.

1893;Welcome to the age of the industrial internet;"Everyone's talking about the ""Internet of Things,"" but what exactly does that mean for our future? In this thoughtful talk, economist Marco Annunziata looks at how technology is transforming the industrial sector, creating machines that can see, feel, sense and react -- so they can be operated far more efficiently. Think: airplane parts that send an alert when they need to be serviced, or wind turbines that communicate with one another to generate more electricity. It's a future with exciting implications for us all.";2;1
1892;A new vision for rebuilding Detroit;Once the powerhouse of America's industrial might, Detroit is more recently known in the popular imagination as a fabulous ruin, crumbling and bankrupt.

Journalist Rose George tours us through the world of shipping, the underpinning of consumer civilization.;2;1
24012;The death of the universe;"The shape, contents and future of the universe are all intricately related. We know that it's mostly flat; we know that it's made up of baryonic matter (like stars and planets), but mostly dark matter and dark energy; and we know that it's expanding constantly, so that all stars will eventually burn out into a cold nothingness. Ren«∏e Hlozek expands on the beauty of this dark ending. [Directed by Giant Animation Studios, narrated by Ren«∏e Hlozek]. ";2;
1891;The 4 stories we tell ourselves about death;"Philosopher Stephen Cave begins with a dark but compelling question: When did you first realize you were going to die? And even more interesting: Why do we humans so often resist the inevitability of death? Cave explores four narratives -- common across civilizations -- that we tell ourselves ""in order to help us manage the terror of death.""";2;
1889;My glacier cave discoveries;Snow Dragon. Pure Imagination. Frozen Minotaur. These are the names Eddy Cartaya and his climbing partner Brent McGregor gave three glacier caves that they were the first to explore. As the Sandy Glacier slowly slides down Mount Hood in Oregon, the caves and tunnels inside it morph annually thanks to warm water from above and warm air from below. At TEDYouth, Cartaya takes us inside these magical spaces where the ice glows in bright blues and greens, and where artifacts rain from the ceiling.;2;
1888;How to build with clay ... and community;Di«∏b«∏do Francis K«∏r«∏ knew exactly what he wanted to do when he got his degree in architecture... He wanted to go home to Gando in Burkina Faso, to help his neighbors reap the benefit of his education. In this charming talk, K«∏r«∏ shows off some of the beautiful structures he's helped to build in his small village in the years since then, including an award-winning primary school made from clay by the entire community.;2;
1890;What I learned from Nelson Mandela;"""In the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the best parts of ourselves reflected back to us."" Boyd Varty, a wildlife activist, shares stories of animals, humans and their interrelatedness, or ""ubuntu"" -- defined as, ""I am, because of you."" And he dedicates the talk to South African leader Nelson Mandela, the human embodiment of that same great-hearted, generous spirit.";2;
1886;Why buses represent democracy in action;"""An advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport,"" argues Enrique Pe«Òalosa. In this spirited talk, the mayor of Bogot«≠ shares some of the tactics he used to change the transportation dynamic in the Colombian capital... and suggests ways to think about building smart cities of the future.";2;
1885;My underwater robot;David Lang is a maker who taught himself to become an amateur oceanographer -- or, he taught a robot to be one for him. In a charming talk Lang, a TED Fellow, shows how he and a network of ocean lovers teamed up to build open-sourced, low-cost underwater explorers.;2;
1883;LetÉ??s try emotional correctness;It's time for liberals and conservatives to transcend their political differences and really listen to each other, says political pundit Sally Kohn. In this optimistic talk, Kohn shares what she learned as a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News. ItÉ??s not about political correctness, she says, but rather, emotional correctness. (Contains profanity.);2;
1882;Body parts on a chip;It's relatively easy to imagine a new medicine -- the hard part is testing it, and that can delay promising new cures for years. In this well-explained talk, Geraldine Hamilton shows how her lab creates organs and body parts on a chip, simple structures with all the pieces essential to testing new medications -- perhaps even custom cures made for one specific person.;2;
24006;The loathsome lethal mosquito;Everyone hates mosquitos. Besides the annoying buzzing and biting, mosquito-borne diseases like malaria kill over a million people each year (plus horses, dogs and cats). And over the past 100 million years, they've gotten good at their job -- sucking up to three times their weight in blood, totally undetected. So shouldn't we just get rid of them? Rose Eveleth shares why scientists aren't sure. [Directed by Karrot Animation, narrated by Rose Eveleth].;2;
1881;Invest in social change;Here's a stat worth knowing: In the UK, 63% of men who finish short-term prison sentences are back inside within a year for another crime. Helping them stay outside involves job training, classes, therapy. And it would pay off handsomely -- but the government can't find the funds. Toby Eccles shares an imaginative idea for how to change that:∂ˇthe Social Impact Bond. It's an unusual bond that helps fund initiatives with a social goal through private money -- with the government paying back the investors (with interest) if the initiatives work.;2;
1880;Want to be happy? Be grateful;The one thing all humans have in common is that each of us wants to be happy, says Brother David Steindl-Rast, a monk and interfaith scholar. And happiness, he suggests, is born from gratitude. An inspiring lesson in slowing down, looking where you're going, and above all, being grateful.;2;
1879;What is so special about the human brain?;"The human brain is puzzling -- it is curiously large given the size of our bodies, uses a tremendous amount of energy for its weight and has a bizarrely dense cerebral cortex. But: why? Neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel puts on her detective's cap and leads us through this mystery. By making ""brain soup,"" she arrives at a startling conclusion.";2;
1877;How societies can grow old better;There's an irony behind the latest efforts to extend human life: It's no picnic to be an old person in a youth-oriented society. Older people can become isolated, lacking meaningful work and low on funds. In this intriguing talk, Jared Diamond looks at how many different societies treat their elders -- some better, some worse -- and suggests we all take advantage of experience.;2;
1878;"How your ""working memory"" makes sense of the world";"""Life comes at us very quickly, and what we need to do is take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it."" In this funny, enlightening talk, educational psychologist Peter Doolittle details the importance -- and limitations -- of your ""working memory,"" that part of the brain that allows us to make sense of what's happening right now.";2;
1876;No roads? There's a drone for that;A billion people in the world lack access to all-season roads. Could the structure of the internet provide a model for how to reach them? Andreas Raptopoulos of Matternet thinks so. He introduces a new type of transportation system that uses electric autonomous flying machines to deliver medicine, food, goods and supplies wherever they are needed.;2;
1875;Meet the robots for humanity;Paralyzed by a stroke, Henry Evans uses a telepresence robot to take the stage and show how new robotics, tweaked and personalized by a group called Robots for Humanity, help him live his life to the full. He shows off a nimble little quadrotor drone, created by a team led by Chad Jenkins, that gives him the ability to once again stroll a garden, visit a campus or give a TEDx Talk.;2;
24003;The chemistry of cookies;"You stick cookie dough into an oven, and magically, you get a plate of warm, gooey cookies. Except it's not magic; it's science. Stephanie Warren explains via basic chemistry principles how the dough spreads out, at what temperature we can kill salmonella, and why that intoxicating smell wafting from your oven indicates that the cookies are ready for eating. [Directed by Augenblick Studios, narrated by Addison Anderson].";2;
1874;Ecology from the air;"What are our forests really made of? From the air, ecologist Greg Asner uses a spectrometer and high-powered lasers to map nature in meticulous kaleidoscopic 3D detail -- what he calls ""a very high-tech accounting system"" of carbon. In this fascinating talk, Asner gives a clear message: To save our ecosystems, we need more data, gathered in new ways.";2;
1872;A drone's-eye view of conservation;Ecologist Lian Pin Koh makes a persuasive case for using drones to protect the world's forests and wildlife. These lightweight autonomous flying vehicles can track animals in their natural habitat, monitor the health of rainforests, even combat crime by detecting poachers via thermal imaging. Added bonus? They're also entirely affordable.;2;
1866;Massively multi-playerÉ?› thumb-wrestling?;"What happens when you get an entire audience to stand up and connect with one another? Chaos, that's what. At least, that's what happened when Jane McGonigal tried to teach TED to play her favorite game. Then again, when the game is ""massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,"" what else would you expect?";2;
1873;What doctors can learn from each other;Different hospitals produce different results on different procedures. Only, patients donÉ??t know that data, making choosing a surgeon a high-stakes guessing game. Stefan Larsson looks at what happens when doctors measure and share their outcomes on hip replacement surgery, for example, to see which techniques are proving the most effective. Could health care get better -- and cheaper -- if doctors learn from each other in a continuous feedback loop?;2;1
1864;The link between unemployment and terrorism;For the young and unemployed in the world's big cities, dreams of opportunity and wealth do come true -- but too often because they're heavily recruited by terrorist groups and other violent organizations. Human rights advocate Mohamed Ali draws on stories from his native Mogadishu to make a powerful case for innovation incubators for our cities' young and ambitious.;2;
1863;Design with the blind in mind;"What would a city designed for the blind be like? Chris Downey is an architect who went suddenly blind in 2008; he contrasts life in his beloved San Francisco before and after -- and shows how the thoughtful designs that enhance his life now might actually make everyone's life better, sighted or not.";2;
1842;Is China the new idol for emerging economies?;The developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism, democracy and political rights for all. Those in emerging markets often don't have that luxury. In this powerful talk, economist Dambisa Moyo makes the case that the west can't afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow. Instead, a different model, embodied by China, is increasingly appealing. A call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world.;2;
1862;The magic of Fibonacci numbers;Math is logical, functional and just ... awesome. Mathemagician Arthur Benjamin explores hidden properties of that weird and wonderful set of numbers, the Fibonacci series. (And reminds you that mathematics can be inspiring, too!);2;
23998;Why is yawning contagious?;*Yaaawwwwwn* Did just reading the word make you feel like yawning yourself? Known as contagious yawning, the reasons behind this phenomenon have been attributed to both the physiological and psychological. It's been observed in children as young as four and even in dogs! Claudia Aguirre visits the many intriguing theories that might explain contagious yawning. [Directed by Biljana Labovic, narrated by Julianna Zarzycki].;2;
1861;How the NSA betrayed the world's trust -- time to act;Recent events have highlighted, underlined and bolded the fact that the United States is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an American entity -- whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not. This means that, essentially, every international user of the internet is being watched, says Mikko Hypponen. An important rant, wrapped with a plea: to find alternative solutions to using American companies for the world's information needs.;2;
19133;How jiu jitsu taught me to be a better employee;Can jiu jitsu make you a better employee? Francesca Simon-Carboni would never have been described as calm or level-headed in a crisis... until she started taking jiu jitsu. Francesca shares how the skills she built in jiu jitsu practice helped her advance in her career off the mat.;2;15
19101;Economics and art;What lessons can economics learn from art? Megan Wilkens examines how, historically, trends in the art world have offered a prescient window into wide-ranging socio-economic shifts in society. If economists look closely at art, they might be privy to unexpected changes in cultural behavior.;2;15
19092;Democratizing investing;In 2013, the largest experiment in crowd-sourced investing happened in Australia, as everyday citizens took the reins on investing the country's pension fund. Nathan Ide explores how certain cultural characteristics of Australians have inspired this groundbreaking model for managing pensions.;2;15
19115;Bring out your inner filmmaker;"Video is ubiquitous. Companies use it for entertainment, marketing, training É?? and customers generally expect it. Mark Halliday describes ""Studio in a Box,"" a program he put together which allows State Street employees to make professional-quality videos of their own.";2;15
19126;The upside of data;Jessica Donohue examines what she's learned from her career working with data, how old industry lessons still apply as we enter the era of Big Data, and why passion still (and always) matters when it comes to data analysis.;2;15
19136;Cultural clashes in defining beauty;Delali Bright shares her personal story of how growing up in West Africa, she was bullied and marginalized for being skinny. Her family worried about her, put her on diets, and found her embarrassing and shameful. Then, she moved to the U.S. in her 30s, where she was suddenly seen as beautiful! Through her story, Delali illuminates the importance of creating your own self image.;2;15
19138;Making a difference in the world;Alison Quirk tells the personal story of taking in a teenager from Nigeria who was recruited to play basketball at her daughter's high school. Through midnight phone calls, hospital visits, and important milestones, Alison explores the wonderful messiness of families É?? and how to leave a mark on the world.;2;15
1860;The paralyzed rat that walked;A spinal cord injury can sever the communication between your brain and your body, leading to paralysis. Fresh from his lab, Gr«∏goire Courtine shows a new method -- combining drugs, electrical stimulation and a robot -- that could re-awaken the neural pathways and help the body learn again to move on its own. See how it works, as a paralyzed rat becomes able to run and navigate stairs.;2;
23997;The fight for the right to vote in the United States;In the United States today, if you are over eighteen, a citizen, and the resident of a state, you can vote (with some exceptions). So, how have voting rights changed since the first election in 1789? Nicki Beaman Griffin outlines the history of the long fight for a more inclusive electorate. [Directed by Darcy Vorhees, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
1858;What I discovered in New York City  trash;New York City residents produce 11,000 tons of garbage every day. Every day! This astonishing statistic is just one of the reasons Robin Nagle started a research project with the city's Department of Sanitation. She walked the routes, operated mechanical brooms, even drove a garbage truck herself--all so she could answer a simple-sounding but complicated question: who cleans up after us?;2;
1859;The deadly genius of drug cartels;Up to 100,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico in the last 6 years. We might think this has nothing to do with us, but in fact we are all complicit, says Yale professor Rodrigo Canales in this unflinching talk that turns conventional wisdom about drug cartels on its head. The carnage is not about faceless, ignorant goons mindlessly killing each other but is rather the result of some seriously sophisticated brand management.;2;
1790;The art of bow-making;Dong Woo Jang has an unusual after school hobby. Jang, who was 15 when he gave the talk, tells the story of how living in the concrete jungle of Seoul inspired him to build the perfect bow. Watch him demo one of his beautiful hand-crafted archer's bows.;2;
23995;Mysteries of vernacular: Robot;In 1920, Czech writer Karel é?apek wrote a play about human-like machines, thereby inventing the term robot from the Central European word for forced labor. Jessica Oreck and Rachael Teel explain how the science fiction staple earned its name. ;2;
1857;Why stay in Chernobyl? Because it's home.;"Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident and, for the past 27 years, the area around the plant has been known as the Exclusion Zone. And yet, a community of about 200 people live there -- almost all of them elderly women. These proud grandmas defied orders to relocate because their connection to their homeland and to their community are ""forces that rival even radiation.""";2;
1856;"Life in the ""digital now""";One year ago, Abha Dawesar was living in blacked-out Manhattan post-Sandy, scrounging for power to connect. As a novelist, she was struck by this metaphor: Have our lives now become fixated on the drive to digitally connect, while we miss out on what's real?;2;
1783;A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis;There's a farming crisis no one is talking about: The world is running out of phosphorus, an essential element that's a key component of DNA and the basis of cellular communication. As biologist Mohamed Hijri shows, all roads of this crisis lead back to how we farm -- with chemical fertilizers chock-full of the element, which plants are not efficient at absorbing. One solution? A microscopic mushroom ...;4;
1855;Government -- investor, risk-taker, innovator;"Why doesn't the government just get out of the way and let the private sector -- the ""real revolutionaries"" -- innovate? It's rhetoric you hear everywhere, and Mariana Mazzucato wants to dispel it. In an energetic talk, she shows how the state -- which many see as a slow, hunkering behemoth -- is really one of our most exciting risk-takers and market-shapers.";2;
1854;Architecture at home in its community;When TED Fellow Xavier Vilalta was commissioned to create a multistory shopping mall in Addis Ababa, he panicked. Other centers represented everything he hated about contemporary architecture: wasteful, glass towers requiring tons of energy whose design had absolutely nothing to do with Africa. In this charming talk, Vilalta shows how he champions an alternative approach: to harness nature, reference design tradition and create beautiful, modern, iconic buildings fit for a community.;2;
1853;Why our universe might exist on a knife-edge;The biggest surprise of discovering the Higgs boson? That there were no surprises. Gian Giudice talks us through a problem in theoretical physics: what if the Higgs field exists in an ultra-dense state that could mean the collapse of all atomic matter? With wit and charm, Giudice outlines a grim fate -- and why we shouldn't start worrying just yet.;2;
1852;An ode to envy;"What is jealousy? What drives it, and why do we secretly love it? No study has ever been able to capture its ""loneliness, longevity, grim thrill"" -- that is, says Parul Sehgal, except for fiction. In an eloquent meditation she scours pages from literature to show how jealousy is not so different from a quest for knowledge.";2;
1851;Africa's next boom;The past decade has seen slow and steady economic growth across the continent of Africa. But economist Charles Robertson has a bold thesis: Africa's about to boom. He talks through a few of the indicators -- from rising education levels to expanded global investment (and not just from China) -- that lead him to predict rapid growth for a billion people, sooner than you may think.;2;
1850;Let's go all-in on selling sustainability;"The big blue buildings of Ikea have sprouted solar panels and wind turbines; inside, shelves are stocked with LED lighting and recycled cotton. Why? Because as Steve Howard puts it: É??Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do.É?ù Howard, the chief sustainability officer at the furniture megastore, talks about his quest to sell eco-friendly materials and practices -- both internally and to worldwide customers -- and lays a challenge for other global giants.";2;
1849;Who am I? Think again;How do we decide who we are? Hetain Patel's surprising performance plays with identity, language and accent -- and challenges you to think deeper than surface appearances. A delightful meditation on self, with performer Yuyu Rau, and inspired by Bruce Lee.;2;
1848;What will a future without secrets look like?;The line between public and private has blurred in the past decade, both online and in real life, and Alessandro Acquisti is here to explain what this means and why it matters. In this thought-provoking, slightly chilling talk, he shares details of recent and ongoing research -- including a project that shows how easy it is to match a photograph of a stranger with their sensitive personal information.;2;
1846;Ingenious homes in unexpected places;"In the center of Caracas, Venezuela, stands the 45-story ""Tower of David,"" an unfinished, abandoned skyscraper. But about eight years ago, people started moving in. Photographer Iwan Baan shows how people build homes in unlikely places, touring us through the family apartments of Torre David, a city on the water in Nigeria, and an underground village in China. Glorious images celebrate humanity's ability to survive and make a home -- anywhere.";2;
1847;We need a heroic narrative for death;"Amanda Bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together -- and up until the final days, too. Bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why, for the loved ones of the dying, having hope for a happy ending shouldn't warrant a diagnosis of ""denial."" She calls for a more heroic narrative for death -- to match the ones we have in life.";2;
23986;The uncertain location of electrons;The tiny atoms that make up our world are made up of even tinier protons, neutrons and electrons. Though the number of protons determines an atom's identity, it's the electrons -- specifically, their exact location outside the nucleus -- that particularly perplex scientists. George Zaidan and Charles Morton show how to make an educated guess of where those itty-bitty freewheeling electrons might be. [Directed by Karrot Animation, narrated by George Zaidan]. ;2;
1843;The walkable city;"How do we solve the problem of the suburbs? Urbanist Jeff Speck shows how we can free ourselves from dependence on the car -- which he calls ""a gas-belching, time-wasting, life-threatening prosthetic device"" -- by making our cities more walkable and more pleasant for more people.";2;
1841;Adventures in Twitter fiction;"In the 1930s, broadcast radio introduced an entirely new form of storytelling; today, micro-blogging platforms like Twitter are changing the scene again. Andrew Fitzgerald takes a look at the (aptly) short but fascinating history of new forms of creative experimentation in fiction and storytelling.";2;
1840;Let's treat violence like a contagious disease;Dr. Gary Slutkin spent a decade fighting tuberculosis, cholera and AIDS epidemics in Africa. When he returned to the US, he thought he'd escape brutal epidemic deaths. But he began to look more carefully at gun violence -- whose spread follows the same pattern as an infectious disease. His conclusion: We've reversed the impact of so many diseases, says Slutkin, and we can do the same with violence. A mind-flipping look at a problem that too many communities have accepted as a given. ;2;
1839;Iran and Israel: Peace is possible;Iran and Israel: two nations with tense relations that seem existentially at odds. But for all their antagonistic rhetoric, there is a recent hidden history of collaboration, even friendship. In an informative talk, Trita Parsi shows how an unlikely strategic alliance in the past could mean peace in the future for these two feuding countries.;2;
2746;The science of stage fright (and how to overcome it);Heart racing, palms sweating, labored breathing? No, you're not having a heart attack -- it's stage fright! If speaking in public makes you feel like you're fighting for your life, you're not alone. But the better you understand your body's reaction, the more likely you are to overcome it. Mikael Cho advises how to trick your brain and steal the show. [Directed by Robertino Zambrano, narrated by Mikael Cho, music by Adam Alexander & John Romeo].;2;
1838;New York's streets? Not so mean any more;In this funny and thought-provoking talk, Janette Sadik-Khan, transportation commissioner of New York City, shares projects that have reshaped street life in the 5 boroughs, including pedestrian zones in Times Square, high-performance buses and a 6,000-cycle-strong bike share. Her mantra: Do bold experiments that are cheap to try out.;2;
1836;Why we shouldn't trust markets with our civic life;"In the past three decades, says Michael Sandel, the US has drifted from a market economy to a market society; it's fair to say that an American's experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have. (Three key examples: access to education, access to justice, political influence.) In a talk and audience discussion, Sandel asks us to think honestly on this question: In our current democracy, is too much for sale?";2;
1837;The case for letting business solve social problems;Why do we turn to nonprofits, NGOs and governments to solve society's biggest problems? Michael Porter admits he's biased, as a business school professor, but he wants you to hear his case for letting business try to solve massive problems like climate change and access to water. Why? Because when business solves a problem, it makes a profit -- which lets that solution grow.;2;
1835;Can technology solve our big problems?;In 1969, Buzz AldrinÉ??s historical step onto the moon leapt mankind into an era of technological possibility. The awesome power of technology was to be used to solve all of our big problems. Fast forward to present day, and what's happened? Are mobile apps all we have to show for ourselves? Journalist Jason Pontin looks closely at the challenges we face to using technology effectively ... for problems that really matter.;2;
1834;Psychedelic science;Swiss artist and photographer Fabian Oefner is on a mission to make eye-catching art from everyday science. In this charming talk, he shows off some recent psychedelic images, including photographs of crystals as they interact with soundwaves. And, in a live demo, he shows what really happens when you mix paint with magnetic liquid--or when you set fire to whiskey.;2;
1833;How I hacked online dating;Amy Webb was having no luck with online dating. The dates she liked didn't write her back, and her own profile attracted crickets (and worse). So, as any fan of data would do: she started making a spreadsheet. Hear the story of how she went on to hack her online dating life -- with frustrating, funny and life-changing results.;2;
23981;The most groundbreaking scientist you've never heard of;Seventeenth-century Danish geologist Nicolas Steno earned his chops at a young age, studying cadavers and drawing anatomic connections between species. Steno made outsized contributions to the field of geology, influencing Charles Lyell, James Hutton and Charles Darwin. Addison Anderson recounts Steno's little-known legacy and lauds his insistence on empiricism over blind theory. [Directed by Anton Bogaty, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
1832;Life that doesn't end with death;In Tana Toraja, weddings and births aren't the social gatherings that knit society together. In this part of Indonesia, big, raucous funerals are at the center of social life. Anthropologist Kelli Swazey takes a look at this culture, in which the bodies of dead relatives are cared for years after they have passed away -- because relationships with loved ones don't simply end when breathing does.;2;
23980;Kabuki: The people's dramatic art;"The Japanese dance and theater art of kabuki, derived from the word kabuku, meaning ""out of the ordinary,"" can be traced back to the streets of seventeenth-century Kyoto. Kabuki became a dramatic art for the common people, with its use of makeup and facial expressions rather than masks, as well as a playful take on current events. Amanda Mattes tracks the evolution of kabuki and its place in Japan's rich cultural heritage. [Directed by Tom Gran, narrated by Addison Anderson].";2;
1831;The unheard story of David and Goliath;It's a classic underdog tale: David, a young shepherd armed only with a sling, beats Goliath, the mighty warrior. The story has transcended its biblical origins to become a common shorthand for unlikely victory. But, asks Malcolm Gladwell, is that really what the David and Goliath story is about?;2;
1830;Confessions of a depressed comic;Kevin Breel didn't look like a depressed kid: team captain, at every party, funny and confident. But he tells the story of the night he realized that -- to save his own life -- he needed to say four simple words.;2;
23979;Are Elvish, Klingon, Dothraki and Na'vi real languages?;What do Game of Thrones' Dothraki, Avatar's Na'vi, Star Trek's Klingon and LOTR's Elvish have in common? They are all fantasy constructed languages, or conlangs. Conlangs have all the delicious complexities of real languages: a high volume of words, grammar rules, and room for messiness and evolution. John McWhorter explains why these invented languages captivate fans long past the rolling credits. [Directed by Joyce Stenneke, narrated by John McWhorter]. ;2;
1828;Why our IQ levels are higher than our grandparents';"It's called the ""Flynn effect"" -- the fact that each generation scores higher on an IQ test than the generation before it. Are we actually getting smarter, or just thinking differently? In this fast-paced spin through the cognitive history of the 20th century, moral philosopher James Flynn suggests that changes in the way we think have had surprising (and not always positive) consequences.";2;
1829;What we don't understand about trust;Trust is on the decline, and we need to rebuild it. That's a commonly heard suggestion for making a better world ... but, says philosopher Onora O'Neill, we don't really understand what we're suggesting. She flips the question, showing us that our three most common ideas about trust are actually misdirected.;2;
1827;The pursuit of ignorance;"What does real scientific work look like? As neuroscientist Stuart Firestein jokes: It looks a lot less like the scientific method and a lot more like ""farting around ... in the dark."" In this witty talk, Firestein gets to the heart of science as it is really practiced and suggests that we should value what we don't know -- or ""high-quality ignorance"" -- just as much as what we know.";2;
23977;The physics of human sperm vs. the physics of the sperm whale;Traveling is extremely arduous for microscopic sperm -- think of a human trying to swim in a pool made of...other humans. We can compare the journey of a sperm to that of a sperm whale by calculating the Reynolds number, a prediction of how fluid will behave, often fluctuating due to size of the swimmer. Aatish Bhatia explores the great (albeit tiny) sperm's journey. [Directed by Brad Purnell, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
1826;How reliable is your memory?;Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus studies memories. More precisely, she studies false memories, when people either remember things that didn't happen or remember them differently from the way they really were. It's more common than you might think, and Loftus shares some startling stories and statistics --  and raises some important ethical questions.;2;
1825;Why mayors should rule the world;"It often seems like federal-level politicians care more about creating gridlock than solving the world's problems. So who's actually getting bold things done? City mayors. So, political theorist Benjamin Barber suggests: Let's give them more control over global policy. Barber shows how these ""urban homeboys"" are solving pressing problems on their own turf -- and maybe in the world.";2;
23976;Light waves, visible and invisible;Each kind of light has a unique wavelength, but human eyes can only perceive a tiny slice of the full spectrum -- the very narrow range from red to violet. Microwaves, radio waves, x-rays and more are hiding, invisible, just beyond our perception. Lucianne Walkowicz shows us the waves we can't see. [Directed by Pew36 Animation Studios, narrated by Lucianne Walkowicz].;2;
1824;Leather and meat without killing animals;By 2050, it will take 100 billion land animals to provide the world's population with meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods. Maintaining this herd will take a huge, potentially unsustainable toll on the planet. What if there were a different way? In this eye-opening talk, tissue engineering advocate Andras Forgacs argues that biofabricating meat and leather is a civilized way to move past killing animals for hamburgers and handbags.;2;
1823;Mapping ideas worth spreading;What do 24,000 ideas look like? Ecologist Eric Berlow and physicist Sean Gourley apply algorithms to the entire archive of TEDx Talks, taking us on a stimulating visual tour to show how ideas connect globally.;2;
1822;Why bees are disappearing;Honeybees have thrived for 50 million years, each colony 40 to 50,000 individuals coordinated in amazing harmony. So why, seven years ago, did colonies start dying en masse? Marla Spivak reveals four reasons which are interacting with tragic consequences. This is not simply a problem because bees pollinate a third of the world's crops. Could this incredible species be holding up a mirror for us?;2;
1820;Everyday cybercrime -- and what you can do about it;How do you pick up a malicious online virus, the kind of malware that snoops on your data and taps your bank account? Often, it's through simple things you do each day without thinking twice. James Lyne reminds us that it's not only the NSA that's watching us, but ever-more-sophisticated cybercriminals, who exploit both weak code and trusting human nature.;2;
1821;The art of misdirection;Hailed as the greatest pickpocket in the world, Apollo Robbins studies the quirks of human behavior as he steals your watch. In a hilarious demonstration, Robbins samples the buffet of the TEDGlobal 2013 audience, showing how the flaws in our perception make it possible to swipe a wallet and leave it on its ownerÉ??s shoulder while they remain clueless.;2;
23973;Urbanization and the evolution of cities across 10,000 years;About 10,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers, aided by rudimentary agriculture, moved to semi-permanent villages and never looked back. With further developments came food surpluses, leading to commerce, specialization and, many years later with the Industrial Revolution, the modern city. Vance Kite plots our urban past and how we can expect future cities to adapt to our growing populations. [Directed by Keaton Tips, narrated by Michelle Snow].;2;
1819;3 reasons we still havenÉ??t gotten rid of malaria;WeÉ??ve known how to cure malaria since the 1600s, so why does the disease still kill hundreds of thousands every year? ItÉ??s more than just a problem of medicine, says journalist Sonia Shah. A look into the history of malaria reveals three big-picture challenges to its eradication. Photos: Adam Nadel.;2;
1818;How technology allowed me to read;Months after he was born, in 1948, Ron McCallum became blind. In this charming, moving talk, he shows how he reads -- and celebrates the progression of clever tools and adaptive computer technologies that make it possible. With their help, and the help of volunteers, he's become a lawyer, an academic, and, most of all, a voracious reader. Welcome to the blind reading revolution.;2;
23972;What are stem cells?;Is personalized medicine for individual bodies in our future? Possibly -- with the use of stem cells, undifferentiated cells with the power to become any tissue in our bodies. Craig A. Kohn describes the role of these incredible, transforming cells and how scientists are harnessing their medical potential. [Directed by Qa'ed Mai, narrated by Michael Molina].;2;
1817;The museum of you;"A third of the world watched live as the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001; a third more heard about it within 24 hours. (Do you remember where you were?) So exhibits at the soon-to-open 9/11 Memorial Museum will reflect the diversity of the world's experiences of that day. In a moving talk, designer Jake Barton gives a peek at some of those installations, as well as several other projects that aim to make the observer an active participant in the exhibit.";2;
23971;What is love?;"Is love a signal winding through your neural pathways? A cliche? A cult? Love is easy to compare but difficult to define, maybe because we're fundamentally biased; we try to define love while falling in or out of it. And love feels differently to every person who feels it, but this subjective emotion has evolutionary explanations, too. Brad Troeger takes a shot at the definition of love. [Directed by STK Films, narrated by Addison Anderson].";2;
1816;For more wonder, rewild the world;Wolves were once native to the US' Yellowstone National Park -- until hunting wiped them out. But when, in 1995, the wolves began to come back (thanks to an aggressive management program), something interesting happened: the rest of the park began to find a new, more healthful balance. In a bold thought experiment, George Monbiot imagines a wilder world in which humans work to restore the complex, lost natural food chains that once surrounded us.;2;
1814;Your body is my canvas;Alexa Meade takes an innovative approach to art. Not for her a life of sketching and stretching canvases. Instead, she selects a topic and then paints it--literally. She covers everything in a scene--people, chairs, food, you name it--in a mask of paint that mimics what's below it. In this eye-opening talk Meade shows off photographs of some of the more outlandish results, and shares a new project involving people, paint and milk.;2;
23969;Cicadas: The dormant army beneath your feet;Every 13 or 17 years, billions of cicadas emerge from the ground to molt, mate and die. Adult cicadas only live a few weeks above ground, but you'd be hard pressed to ignore them -- they are extremely loud! Rose Eveleth explains everything you need to know about these noisy insects, admitting that there's still some things we just don't understand. [Directed by Eli Enigenburg, narrated by Rose Eveleth, music by Kevin MacLeod]. ;2;
1791;The rise of the new global super-rich;Technology is advancing in leaps and bounds -- and so is economic inequality, says writer Chrystia Freeland. In an impassioned talk, she charts the rise of a new class of plutocrats (those who are extremely powerful because they are extremely wealthy), and suggests that globalization and new technology are actually fueling, rather than closing, the global income gap. Freeland lays out three problems with plutocracy É?› and one glimmer of hope.;2;
1815;How to make stress your friend;Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: reaching out to others.;2;
23968;The moon illusion;Have you noticed how the full moon looks bigger on the horizon than high overhead? Actually, the two images are exactly the same size -- so why do we perceive them differently? Scientists aren't sure, but there are plenty of intriguing theories. Andrew Vanden Heuvel unravels the details of focus, distance and proportion that contribute to this mystifying optical illusion. [Directed by Kozmonot Animation Studio, narrated by Michelle Snow].;2;
1811;Why I fell in love with monster prime numbers;They're millions of digits long, and it takes an army of mathematicians and machines to hunt them down -- what's not to love about monster primes? Adam Spencer, comedian and lifelong math geek, shares his passion for these odd numbers, and for the mysterious magic of math.;2;
23965;What is d«∏j«ˇ vu? What is d«∏j«ˇ vu?;You might have felt it -- the feeling that you've experienced something before, but, in reality, the experience is brand new. There are over 40 theories that attempt to explain the phenomenon of d«∏j«ˇ vu. Michael Molina explains how neuroimaging and cognitive psychology have narrowed down the theories that could explain that feeling you're having...again. [Directed by Josh Harris, narrated by Michelle Snow].;2;
23959;Defining cyberwarfare... in hopes of preventing it;Can you imagine a future where wars are fought not with bombs and bullets but computer viruses and pacemaker shutdowns? Cyberware is unique in that it is not covered by existing legal framework and it often inspires more questions than we are yet capable of answering. Daniel Garrie ponders some of the practical and ethical dilemmas that may pop up as we progress towards our uncertain future. [Directed by Brett Underhill, narrated by Michelle Snow].;2;
23958;The Arctic vs. the Antarctic;How can you tell the two poles apart? Where are the penguins? What about the bears? The Arctic pole is located in the Northern Hemisphere within the deep Arctic Ocean, while the Antarctic pole is smack in the middle of the ice-covered Antarctica. Camille Seaman describes how enterprising people and organisms have found ways to reside around both poles despite the frigid temperatures. [Directed by Iuri Ara«ßjo & Guilherme Ara«ßjo, narrated by Michelle Snow].;2;
1812;Making peace is a marathon;In Lebanon there is one gunshot a year that isnÉ??t part of a scene of routine violence: The opening sound of the Beirut International Marathon. In a moving talk, marathon founder May El-Khalil explains why she believed a 26.2-mile running event could bring together a country divided for decades by politics and religion, even if for one day a year.;2;
23956;Should you trust your first impression?;"You can't help it; sometimes, you just get a bad feeling about someone that's hard to shake. So, what's happening in your brain when you make that critical (and often lasting) first judgment? Peter Mende-Siedlecki shares the social psychology of first impressions -- and why they may indicate that, deep down, people are basically good. [Directed by TOGETHER: Words+Pictures for Art & Culture, narrated by Addison Anderson]. ";2;
1813;A mouse. A laser beam. A manipulated memory.;Can we edit the content of our memories? It's a sci-fi-tinged question that Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu are asking in their lab at MIT. Essentially, the pair shoot a laser beam into the brain of a living mouse to activate and manipulate its memory. In this unexpectedly amusing talk they share not only how, but -- more important -- why they do this.;2;
23955;Who won the space race?;On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the satellite Sputnik and, with it, an international space race. The United States and the Soviet Union rushed to declare dominance of space for 18 years, until the two countries agreed to a more collaborative model. The real winner? Science. Jeff Steers describes the history -- and the benefits -- of the space race. [Directed by Nadav Arbel, narrated by Addison Anderson].;2;
1810;Why do we sleep?;Russell Foster is a circadian neuroscientist: He studies the sleep cycles of the brain. And he asks: What do we know about sleep? Not a lot, it turns out, for something we do with one-third of our lives. In this talk, Foster shares three popular theories about why we sleep, busts some myths about how much sleep we need at different ages -- and hints at some bold new uses of sleep as a predictor of mental health.;2;
1809;Emergency shelters made from paper;Long before sustainability was a buzzword, architect Shigeru Ban was using ecologically sound building materials such as cardboard tubes. He uses them to build remarkable temporary structures for disaster-struck nations such as Haiti, Rwanda and Japan. Yet often, these buildings remain a beloved part of the landscape long after they have served their intended purpose.;2;
1773;The dangers of willful blindness;Gayla Benefield was just doing her job -- until she uncovered an awful secret about her hometown that meant its mortality rate was 80 times higher than anywhere else in the US. But when she tried to tell people about it, she learned an even more shocking truth: People didn't want to know. In a talk that's part history lesson, part call-to-action, Margaret Heffernan demonstrates the danger of willful blindness, and praises ordinary people like Benefield who are willing to speak up.;2;
1808;In the key of genius;"Born three and a half months prematurely, Derek Paravicini is blind and has severe autism. But with perfect pitch, innate talent and a lot of practice, he became a concert pianist by the age of 10. Here, his longtime piano teacher, Adam Ockelford, explains his student's unique relationship to music, while Paravicini shows how he has ripped up the ""Chopsticks"" rulebook.";2;
1800;The voices in my head;To all appearances, Eleanor Longden was just like every other student, heading to college full of promise and without a care in the world. That was until the voices in her head started talking. Initially innocuous, these internal narrators became increasingly antagonistic and dictatorial, turning her life into a living nightmare. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized, drugged, Longden was discarded by a system that didn't know how to help her. Longden tells the moving tale of her years-long journey back to mental health, and makes the case that it was through learning to listen to her voices that she was able to survive.;2;
1807;Ingenuity and elegance in ancient African alphabets;"From simple alphabets to secret symbolic languages, graphic designer Saki Mafundikwa celebrates the many forms of written communication across the continent of Africa. He highlights the history and legacy that are embodied in written words and symbols, and urges African designers to draw on these graphic forms for fresh inspiration. It's summed up in his favorite Ghanaian glyph, Sankofa, which means ""return and get it"" -- or ""learn from the past.""";2;
1806;Design for all 5 senses;Good design looks great, yes -- but why shouldn't it also feel great, smell great and sound great? Designer Jinsop Lee (a TED Talent Search winner) shares his theory of 5-sense design, with a handy graph and a few examples. His hope: to inspire you to notice great multisensory experiences.;2;
1805;For argument's sake;Why do we argue? To out-reason our opponents, prove them wrong, and, most of all, to win! Right? Philosopher Daniel H. Cohen shows how our most common form of argument -- a war in which one person must win and the other must lose -- misses out on the real benefits of engaging in active disagreement.;2;
1804;The polyphonic me;Frustrated by not being able to sing two notes at the same time, musical inventor Beardyman built a machine to allow him to create loops and layers from just the sounds he makes with his voice. Given that he can effortlessly conjure the sound of everything from crying babies to buzzing flies, not to mention mimic pretty much any musical instrument imaginable, that's a lot of different sounds. Sit back and let the wall of sound of this dazzling performance wash over you.;2;
1802;Better baby care -- thanks to Formula 1;During a Formula 1 race, a car sends hundreds of millions of data points to its garage for real-time analysis and feedback. So why not use this detailed and rigorous data system elsewhere, like at children's hospitals? Peter van Manen tells us more.;2;
1801;Spider-Man, The Lion King and life on the creative edge;Showing spectacular clips from productions such as Frida, The Tempest and The Lion King, director Julie Taymor describes a life spent immersed in theater and the movies. Filmed right as controversy over her Broadway production of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark was at its peak, she candidly describes the tensions inherent within her creative process, as she strives both to capture the essence of a story--and produce images and experiences unlike anything else.;2;
1799;The fastest ambulance? A motorcycle;"As a young EMT on a Jerusalem ambulance, Eli Beer realized that, stuck in brutal urban traffic, they often arrived too late to help. So he organized a group of volunteer EMTs -- many on foot -- ready to drop everything and dash to save lives in their neighborhood. Today, United Hatzlah uses a smartphone app and a fleet of ""ambucycles"" to help nearby patients until an ambulance arrives. With an average response time of 3 minutes, last year, they treated 207,000 people in Israel. And the idea is going global.";2;
1798;A 3D-printed jumbo jet?;Designer Bastian Schaefer shows off a speculative design for the future of jet planes, with a skeleton inspired by strong, flexible, natural forms and by the needs of the world's, ahem, growing population. Imagine an airplane that's full of light and space -- and built up from generative parts in a 3D printer.;2;
1797;How a penny made me feel like a millionaire;As a young child, Tania Luna left her home in post-Chernobyl Ukraine to take asylum in the US. And one day, on the floor of the New York homeless shelter where she and her family lived, she found a penny. She has never again felt so rich. A meditation on the bittersweet joys of childhood -- and how to hold them in mind.;2;
23942;The terrors of sleep paralysis;Imagine you're fast asleep and then suddenly awake. You want to move but can't, as if someone is sitting on your chest. And you can't even scream! This is sleep paralysis, a creepy but common phenomenon caused by an overlap in REM sleep and waking stages. Ami Angelowicz describes just how pervasive (but harmless) it is and introduces a cast of characters from sleep paralysis around the world. [Directed by Pew36 Animation Studios, narrated by Ami Angelowicz].;2;
1795;Bitcoin. Sweat. Tide. Meet the future of branded currency.;Currency -- the bills and coins you carry in your wallet and in your bank account -- is founded on marketing, on the belief that banks and governments are trustworthy. Now, Paul Kemp-Robertson walks us through a new generation of currency, supported by that same marketing ... but on behalf of a private brand. From Nike Sweat Points to bottles of Tide (which are finding an unexpected use in illegal markets), meet the non-bank future of currencies.;2;
1796;In our baby's illness, a life lesson;"Roberto D'Angelo and Francesca Fedeli thought their baby boy Mario was healthy -- until at 10 days old, they discovered he'd had a perinatal stroke. With Mario unable to control the left side of his body, they grappled with tough questions: Would he be ""normal?É?ù Could he live a full life? The poignant story of parents facing their fears -- and how they turned them around.";2;
1793;DJ decks made of ... paper;"""I love paper, and I love technology,"" says physicist and former sheep herder Kate Stone, who's spent the past decade working to unite the two. Her experiments combine regular paper with conductive inks and tiny circuit boards to offer a unique, magical experience. To date, applications include a newspaper embedded with audio and video, posters that display energy usage in real time, and the extremely nifty paper drumkit and set of DJ decks she demonstrates onstage.";2;
23938;A brief history of plural word...s;All it takes is a simple S to make most English words plural. But it hasn't always worked that way (and there are, of course, exceptions). John McWhorter looks back to the good old days when English was newly split from German -- and books, names and eggs were beek, namen and eggru! [Directed by Lippy, narrated by John McWhorter].;2;
1794;Our shared condition -- consciousness;Philosopher John Searle lays out the case for studying human consciousness -- and systematically shoots down some of the common objections to taking it seriously. As we learn more about the brain processes that cause awareness, accepting that consciousness is a biological phenomenon is an important first step. And no, he says, consciousness is not a massive computer simulation.;2;
1792;The orchestra in my mouth;In a highly entertaining performance, beatboxer Tom Thum slings beats, comedy and a mouthful of instrumental impersonations into 11 minutes of creativity and fun that will make you smile.;2;
23936;How to read music;Like an actor's script, a sheet of music instructs a musician on what to play (the pitch) and when to play it (the rhythm). Sheet music may look complicated, but once you've gotten the hang of a few simple elements like notes, bars and clefs, you're ready to rock. Tim Hansen hits the instrumental basics you need to read music. [Directed by Thomas Parrinello, narrated by Tim Hansen].;2;
1789;Where is home?;More and more people worldwide are living in countries not considered their own. Writer Pico Iyer  -- who himself has three or four É??originsÉ?ù -- meditates on the meaning of home, the joy of traveling and the serenity of standing still.;2;
1780;Cloudy with a chance of joy;You don't need to plan an exotic trip to find creative inspiration. Just look up, says Gavin Pretor-Pinney, founder of the Cloud Appreciation Society. As he shares charming photos of nature's finest aerial architecture, Pretor-Pinney calls for us all to take a step off the digital treadmill, lie back and admire the beauty in the sky above.;2;
23933;What is dyslexia?;"Dyslexia affects up to 1 in 5 people, but the experience of dyslexia isn't always the same. This difficulty in processing language exists along a spectrum -- one that doesn't necessarily fit with labels like ""normal"" and ""defective."" Kelli Sandman-Hurley urges us to think again about dyslexic brain function and to celebrate the neurodiversity of the human brain. [Directed by Marc Christoforidis, narrated by Michelle Snow].";2;
1788;The voice of the natural world;Bernie Krause has been recording wild soundscapes -- the wind in the trees, the chirping of birds, the subtle sounds of insect larvae -- for 45 years. In that time, he has seen many environments radically altered by humans, sometimes even by practices thought to be environmentally safe. A surprising look at what we can learn through nature's symphonies, from the grunting of a sea anemone to the sad calls of a beaver in mourning.;2;
1761;Sex needs a new metaphor. Here's one ...;For some reason, says educator Al Vernacchio, the metaphors for talking about sex in the US all come from baseball -- scoring, getting to first base, etc. The problem is, this frames sex as a competition, with a winner and a loser. Instead, he suggests a new metaphor, one that's more about shared pleasure, discussion and agreement, fulfillment and enjoyment. Let's talk about É?› pizza.;2;
23931;Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man of math;What's so special about Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man? With arms outstretched, the man fills the irreconcilable spaces of a circle and a square -- symbolizing the Renaissance-era belief in the mutable nature of humankind. James Earle explains the geometric, religious and philosophical significance of this deceptively simple drawing. [Directed by Franz Palomares, narrated by James Earle].;2;
1787;A promising test for pancreatic cancer ... from a teenager;Over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late, when someone has less than two percent chance of survival. How could this be? Jack Andraka talks about how he developed a promising early detection test for pancreatic cancer that's super cheap, effective and non-invasive -- all before his 16th birthday.;2;
23930;The infinite life of pi;The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is always the same: 3.14159... and on and on (literally!) forever. This irrational number, pi, has an infinite number of digits, so we'll never figure out its exact value no matter how close we seem to get. Reynaldo Lopes explains pi's vast applications to the study of music, financial models, and even the density of the universe. [Directed by Igor Coric, narrated by Addison Anderson]. ;2;
1786;The interspecies internet? An idea in progress;Apes, dolphins and elephants are animals with remarkable communication skills. Could the internet be expanded to include sentient species like them? A new and developing idea from a panel of four great thinkers -- dolphin researcher Diana Reiss, musician Peter Gabriel, internet of things visionary Neil Gershenfeld and Vint Cerf, one of the fathers of the internet.;2;
23929;Comma story;It isn't easy holding complex sentences together (just ask a conjunction or a subordinate), but the clever little comma can help lighten the load. But how to tell when help is really needed? Terisa Folaron offers some tricks of the comma trade. [Directed by Brett Underhill, narrated by Julianna Zarzycki]. ;2;
1785;Why we should build wooden skyscrapers;Building a skyscraper? Forget about steel and concrete, says architect Michael Green, and build it out of É?› wood. As he details in this intriguing talk, it's not only possible to build safe wooden structures up to 30 stories tall (and, he hopes, higher), it's necessary.;2;
23928;Myths and misconceptions about evolution;"How does evolution really work? Actually, not how some of our common evolutionary metaphors would have us believe. For instance, it's species, not individual organisms, that adapt to produce evolution, and genes don't ""want"" to be passed on -- a gene can't want anything at all! Alex Gendler sets the record straight on the finer points of evolution. [Directed by Giant Animation Studios, narrated by Julianna Zarzycki]. ";2;
1784;Meet global corruption's hidden players;When the son of the president of a desperately poor country starts buying mansions and sportscars on an official monthly salary of $7,000, Charmian Gooch suggests, corruption is probably somewhere in the picture. In a blistering, eye-opening talk (with several specific examples), she details how global corruption trackers follow the money -- to some surprisingly familiar faces.;2;
23927;Free falling in outer space;If you were to orbit the Earth, you'd experience the feeling of free fall, not unlike what your stomach feels before a big dive on a roller coaster. With a little help from Sir Isaac Newton, Matt J. Carlson explains the basic forces acting on an astronaut and why you probably shouldn't try this one at home. [Directed by Josh Harris, narrated by Matt J. Carlson].;2;
1782;Bluegrass virtuosity from ... New Jersey?;All under the age of 16, brothers Jonny, Robbie and Tommy Mizzone are from New Jersey, a US state that's better known for the rock of Bruce Springsteen than the bluegrass of Earl Scruggs. Nonetheless, the siblings began performing bluegrass covers, as well as their own compositions, at a young age. Here, they play three dazzling songs in three different keys, passing the lead back and forth from fiddle to banjo to guitar.;2;
1781;Reach into the computer and grab a pixel;The border between our physical world and the digital information surrounding us has been getting thinner and thinner. Designer and engineer Jinha Lee wants to dissolve it altogether. As he demonstrates in this short, gasp-inducing talk, his ideas include a pen that penetrates into a screen to draw 3D models and SpaceTop, a computer desktop prototype that lets you reach through the screen to manipulate digital objects.;2;
1779;The big-data revolution in health care;Collecting global health data is an imperfect science: Workers tramp through villages to knock on doors and ask questions, write the answers on paper forms, then input the data -- and from this messy, gappy information, countries and NGOs need to make huge decisions. Data geek Joel Selanikio talks through the sea change in collecting health data in the past decade -- starting with the PalmPilot and Hotmail, and now moving into the cloud.;2;
23923;Inside your computer;How does a computer work? The critical components of a computer are the peripherals (including the mouse), the input/output subsystem (which controls what and how much information comes in and out), and the central processing unit (the brains), as well as human-written programs and memory. Bettina Bair walks us through the steps your computer takes with every click of the mouse. [Directed by Darcy Vorhees, narrated by Michelle Snow].;2;
1778;A tale of two political systems;It's a standard assumption in the West: As a society progresses, it eventually becomes a capitalist, multi-party democracy. Right? Eric X. Li, a Chinese investor and political scientist, begs to differ. In this provocative, boundary-pushing talk, he asks his audience to consider that there's more than one way to run a successful modern nation.;2;
1762;Why we will rely on robots;Scaremongers play on the idea that robots will simply replace people on the job. In fact, they can become our essential collaborators, freeing us up to spend time on less mundane and mechanical challenges. Rodney Brooks points out how valuable this could be as the number of working-age adults drops and the number of retirees swells. He introduces us to Baxter, the robot with eyes that move and arms that react to touch, which could work alongside an aging population -- and learn to help them at home, too.;2;
23921;If superpowers were real: Invisibility;What if invisibility wasn't just the stuff of epic comic book stories? Is it scientifically possible to be invisible? In this series Joy Lin tackles six superpowers and reveals just how scientifically realistic they can be to us mere mortals. [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by James Arnold Taylor].;2;

In this series Joy Lin tackles six superpowers and reveals just how scientifically realistic they can be to us mere mortals. [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by James Arnold Taylor].;2;
23919;If superpowers were real: Immortality;What if immortality wasn't just the stuff of epic comic book stories? Is it scientifically possible to be immortal? In this series Joy Lin tackles six superpowers and reveals just how scientifically realistic they can be to us mere mortals. [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by James Arnold Taylor].;2;
23918;If superpowers were real: Super strength;What if super strength wasn't just the stuff of epic comic book stories? Is it scientifically possible to be super strong? In this series, Joy Lin tackles six superpowers and reveals just how scientifically realistic they can be to us mere mortals. [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by James Arnold Taylor].;2;
23917;If superpowers were real: Super speed;What if super speed wasn't just the stuff of epic comic book stories? Is it scientifically possible to be super speed? In this series Joy Lin tackles six superpowers and reveals just how scientifically realistic they can be to us mere mortals. [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by James Arnold Taylor].;2;
23916;If superpowers were real: Body mass;What if manipulating body mass wasn't just the stuff of epic comic book stories? Is it scientifically possible to manipulate your body mass? In this series Joy Lin tackles six superpowers and reveals just how scientifically realistic they can be to us mere mortals. [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by James Arnold Taylor].;2;
1777;How we'll resurrect the gastric brooding frog, the Tasmanian tiger;The gastric brooding frog lays its eggs just like any other frog -- then swallows them whole to incubate. That is, it did until it went extinct 30 years ago. Paleontologist Michael Archer makes a case to bring back the gastric brooding frog and the thylacine, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger.;2;
23915;How to set the table;Can't remember where your soup spoon ought to go? What about your salad fork? Knowing how to set a traditional table can seem like antiquated etiquette -- but it can come in handy! Anna Post, great-great-granddaughter of etiquette expert Emily Post, shows how to set a table with a plate full of tips and tricks to boot -- even your grandmother will be impressed. [Narrated by Anna Post].;2;
1776;Anatomy of a New Yorker cartoon;"The New Yorker receives around 1,000 cartoons each week; it only publishes about 17 of them. In this hilarious, fast-paced, and insightful talk, the magazine's longstanding cartoon editor and self-proclaimed ""humor analyst"" Bob Mankoff dissects the comedy within just some of the ""idea drawings"" featured in the magazine, explaining what works, what doesn't, and why.";2;
23913;Is there a center of the universe?;"It's been a long road to the discovery that Earth is not the center of the Solar System, the Milky Way, or the universe; great thinkers from Aristotle to Bruno have grappled with it for millennia. But if we aren't at the center of the universe, what is? Marjee Chmiel and Trevor Owens discuss where we stand in the (very) big scheme of things. [Directed by Qa'ed Mai, narrated by Michelle Snow].";2;
1774;Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem?;As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.;2;
23912;How big is the ocean?;While the Earth's oceans are known as five separate entities, there is really only one ocean. So, how big is it? As of 2013, it takes up 71% of the Earth, houses 99% of the biosphere, and contains some of Earth's grandest geological features. Scott Gass reminds us of the influence humans have on the ocean and the influence it has on us. [Directed by 20 Steps, narrated by Scott Gass]. ;2;
1772;The doubt essential to faith;When Lesley Hazleton was writing a biography of Muhammad, she was struck by something: The night he received the revelation of the Koran, according to early accounts, his first reaction was doubt, awe, even fear. And yet this experience became the bedrock of his belief. Hazleton calls for a new appreciation of doubt and questioning as the foundation of faith -- and an end to fundamentalism of all kinds.;2;
1763;Photos from a storm chaser;Photographer Camille Seaman has been chasing storms for 5 years. In this talk she shows stunning, surreal photos of the heavens in tumult.;2;
